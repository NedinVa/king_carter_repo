Notes on Carter letters

*Save individual letters in individual files. 

*File naming scheme:
Begin with "C" (for Carter), 
followed by 2-digit year, 
followed by single letter of alphabet to designate the month 
	(a=January, b=February, etc.)
followed by 2-digit day
followed by letter a, b, c etc to distinguish between different letters
written on the same day.

For example, a letter written on June 15, 1702 would be called:
	C02f15a

*General mark-up notes:

The largest division should be <div1> 

	<div1 type="letter" n="1701-05-22">
	

Every <div> must have a <head> which immediately follows it

	<div1 type="notes">

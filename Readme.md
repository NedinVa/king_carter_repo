# The Diary, Correspondence, and Papers of Robert "King" Carter of Virginia, 1701-1732

This is a git port of the SVN repo for the Carter Papers

## Install the Client

* Follow the Guide for [Getting Started with GitHub for Windows](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows)
* Specifically, install the [Client for Windows](https://windows.github.com/).

## Get the Code
In `git`, when you get the source code, you make a *clone* of the *origin*
(where you're getting the data). On the right, find the button "Clone in
Desktop". This will launch the GitHub git client and get the code for
you. It will ask you where you want to save the files; it doesn't
matter, just remember where it is.

## Editing
The organization of the code is the same as it is on the site, starting
with `index.html` as the file at http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/. Edit
with your favorite text editor ([Sublime
Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) is a nice one.

## Pushing
Once you're ready to get your changes to GitHub, open the GitHub client.
Add a **summary** and a brief **description** for the change. Something
like this is fine (but is required):

```
Text Updates

Updated the text on x file
```

When you're done, click the "**Commit & Sync**" button.

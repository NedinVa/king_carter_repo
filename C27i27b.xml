<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark (b. 1685) was a  prominent Glasgow merchant in the sugar trade.  "John Stark, another Revolutioner provost, was born in 1685, the son of a merchant, and was admitted a burgess by right of his father in 1706. He was brought into the magistracy in 1724 as dean of guild and then chosen as provost in 1725. Stark's election as provost was quite unusual, because, while all the provosts from the Union until 1724 had experience of serving as merchant-baillie, he had none. This probably indicates that Stark represented a new force of 
urban politics which came into the council in 1724. . . . " He served as as baillie and provost (mayor) from 1725-1727. (<cit><bibl>Hisashi Kuboyama. "The Politics of the People in Glasgow and the West of Scotland, 1707-c. 1785." [Ph.D. thesis, University of Edinborough, 2012.], p. 66.</bibl></cit>; and <cit><bibl>"Provosts of Glasgow" at <xref to="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=3052">"Welcome to Glasgow."</xref></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Fabric that has been milled is "made of cloth thickened by fulling," that is, it has been treated by "the process of cleansing and thickening . . . by beating and washing. . . . " (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary</title> online.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] According to the <title>Oxford English Dictionary</title>, plaiting is " a thing made of plaited [braided] strands; a collection or construction of plaits or pleats." </note>

<note id="n5">[5] By a "Kilmarnock cap" Carter means a cap similar to those made in the Scots town of Kilmarnok,  probably  "resembling a tam-o'-shanter."  "The Kilmarnock bonnet has gone through various stages of development over over a period of 250 years.  This a traditional Scottish hat that can be worn as part of formal or informal Highland dress and Dates back to at least the 16th century. It originally took it's <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>]</add> form as the form of a knitted, soft wool cap with a flat crown."  "Kilmarnock was known as early as 1656  for the "knitting of bonnets and spinning (sic) of Scottish cloth."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary</title> online; </bibl></cit> <cit><bibl> "House of Labhran--Vintage Gentleman's Wardrobe:  <xref to="http://houseoflabhran.com/blog/2013/09/20/kilmarnock-bonnet-scottish-hat-history/">Kilmarnock bonnet --Scottish hat history</xref>"; </bibl></cit>; and <cit><bibl>Robin Smith.<title> The Making of Scotland: A Comprehensive Guide to the Growth of Its Cities, Towns, and Villages.</title> [Edinbrough:  Canongate Books, 2001.]  p. 519.)</bibl></cit>) </note>

<note id="n6">[6] James Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official of John Stark's firm on a trading vessel who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. He was aboard the <hi rend="italics">Charles,</hi> a Glasgow ship that was owned by Stark. Carter specifically refers to "Your Ship"
and "the Charles of Glasgow" in a <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C23i04a.html">letter to Stark</xref> of September 4, 1723. </note>

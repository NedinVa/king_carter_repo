<salute>Sir,</salute>

<p>We find by Several of Our Father's letters <add place="supralinear">a year or two ago</add> that He inten <lb/>
ded to make use of your assi<corr resp="editor">[s]</corr>tance  in payng part of the Purchase <lb/>
Money for <note n="LL">Mr. Lloyd's Estate,</note> that his cash in Mr. <note n="MP2">Alderman Per- <lb/>
ry's</note> Hands might not be too much drained. How He might alter his <lb/>
Design afterwards, We <abbr expan="cannot">can't</abbr> say, but We find the Purchase was com <lb/>
<sic corr="pleted">pleated</sic> without any <sic corr="drafts">Draughts</sic> on You. By this Means great dis <lb/>
putes have arisen <hi rend="underline">between Our Father and the Alderman</hi> upon <lb/>
Account of the Discounts not being allowed <hi rend="underline">on his Tobaccos</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">He</hi> <add place="supralinear">the Alderman</add> <lb/>
has before now seen how unkindly it was <del>its</del> taken <del>that</del> by our Father <lb/>
that He could not have the usual Advantages after <add place="supralinear">so large a sum of </add>his Money <lb/>
had <sic corr="lain">layn</sic> idle three or four Years, subject indeed to a payment in <lb/>
the Court in Chancery, but without any Benefit in the mean time. <lb/>
In Some of His Letters He tells the Alderman, He hoped to make him <lb/>
such Remittances as would retreive his Credit in his Books and in <lb/>
some measure make up the Prodigious Breach, which this large <lb/>
Purchase had made. How this could have been effected, We cannot <lb/>
at present <del>tell</del> pretend to guess, unless by Bills drawn on You or <lb/>
Mr. <note n="JP">John Pemberton</note> of <name type="city">Liverpool</name>. But we find such a large <lb/>
Quantity of Tobacco <add place="supralinear">now</add> sent to this Gentleman, a very great part of <lb/>
which is Stemmed and consequently for home Consumption, that <lb/>
We can't imagine He could design to draw anything considerable <lb/>
on <del>this Gent</del> him, when there would not sdufficient remain to clear <lb/>
the Duties. The Conclusion must then be that He intended to have or- <lb/>
<abbr expan="dered">der'd</abbr> some of the Money in Your Possession to be paid to the Alderman <lb/>
who will not otherwise have Money of Our Father's Estate to clear all <lb/>
the Duties of Tobacco's consigned to him this present Year <add place="supralinear">for we do not think proper to touch the Bank Stock</add> not to <lb/>
mention any thing of a large Sum He is to pay to <note n="TF">Lord Fairfax.</note>

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
Every Person has a Right to use his Own in the Manner He <lb/>
thinks most for his Advantage, but we have been thus part- <lb/>
tcular, that We might take off all Imputation of Unkindness <lb/>
or Jealousie, which with truth We assure You is very far from <lb/>
Our thoughts. <del>The</del> We have now sent an Order on you to pay to <lb/>
pay <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>]</add> to Micajah Perry <abbr expan="Esquire">Esqr.</abbr> and Company the Sum of One <lb/>
Thousand Pounds Sterling, which We verily believe Our Father <lb/>
would have done, if He had lived <sic corr="until">'till</sic> this time, and We per <lb/>
suade Ourselves You will not blame Us in Your own Thoughts <lb/>
for desiring to make the Most of Our Tobacco.

Your Most humble Servants

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, Sr., and Jr., March 25, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry and his grandson of the same name, March 25, 1721, that Edmund Jening's son has been quick to take money from Carter, but is reluctant to write to his father, and collecting money from him is difficult. He adds that both Jenings are in debt to him. He is suffering from the gout, and reports Mann Page's loss of his house and store from a fire on Marth 8th. Although the Perrys have written gloomily about the market for tobacco, Mr. Wormeley's tobacco has fetched a good price. The governor, Alexander Spotswood, is at his iron mine at Germanna and is pursuing the work strenuously. There is to be a meeting of the trustees of the College of William and Mary to settle their differences. Carter added in his hand to the clerk's draft a request to be sent salt.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi>  Robert Carter Letter Book, 1720 July-1721 July, BR 227, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. Printed: <cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> pp. 89-91.</bibl></cit></note><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] This Arthur Lee may be a son of Francis Lee (1648-1724), third son of Richard Lee the emigrant; Francis had returned to England to become a merchant in London.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Wormeley (1689-1727), one of Ralph Wormeley's (d.
1701) sons for whom RC was a trustee.</note>

<note id="n3">[3]  Alexander Spotswood (1646-1740) was the governor from 1710 to 1722.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Alexander Spotswood had been interested in mining iron ore in Virginia from about 1710, and had helped pay the expenses of some German miners brought into the colony in 1714. They were settled in Orange County, and the settlement came to be known as Gemana. In 1732, he was to assert to William Byrd that he not only was "the first in this County, but the first in North America, who had erected a regular furnace." (<cit><bibl n="B21">Dodson. <title>Alexander Spotswood.</title> pp. 229-231, 296, 298, 300.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n5">[5] Carter refers to the long controversy between James Blair and Alexander Spotswood, often spilling over into the trustees of the College of William and Mary, that caused great contention in Virginia and resulted in the replacement of Spotswood with Hugh Drysdale in September 1722. (<cit><bibl n="B2">Rouse. <title>James Blair of Virginia.</title>)</bibl>
</cit></note>

<note id="n6">[6] The last words of this letter, beginning with "I want," were added to the draft by Carter in his hand as is shown by the use of italics.</note>

<p>Robert Carter writes to [Benedict Leonard Calvert], Governor of Maryland, June 24, 1727, to alert Calvert that he has issued a "hue and Cry" for the apprehension of Philip Hammond, William Hammond, and John Howard who are accused of robbing Richard Thacker in Virginia's King William County. He has directed the victim, Richard Thacker, to report to Calvert for such "process" as Calvert shall direct, and then to appear in a  Virginia court with his witnesses to the robbery.</p>

There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.

Proceedings of the Council of Maryland, 1698-1731.</hi> (Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 1905.) pp. 471-72.

<note>Carter had difficulty in composing this letter, and there are two earlier drafts of it in the letterbook:</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Hue and cry" was the "early English legal practice of pursuing a criminal with cries and sounds of alarm. It was the duty of any person wronged or discovering a felony to raise the hue and cry, and his neighbours were bound to come and assist him in the pursuit and apprehension of the offender. All those joining in the pursuit were justified in arresting the person pursued, even if it turned out that he was innocent."

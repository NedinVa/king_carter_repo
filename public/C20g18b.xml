<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Richard Perry, July 18,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Richard Perry, July 18,
1720, concerning the investment of a large sum of money that he
expects to earn from his current tobacco sales, reminding Perry of an
offer that he had made to invest &pound;2,000 with Perry at 5 percent
interest to which Perry had not responded. He tells Perry that he
will approve if Perry takes Carter's funds out of an annuity and
hopes he will then keep it at interest, and he prods Perry further by
noting that he knows of someone who will accept his funds for
investment.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

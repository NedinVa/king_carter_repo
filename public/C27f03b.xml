<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, June 3, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 3, 1727, to advise the merchant of the arrival of his ship, the <hi rend="italics">Vine, </hi>and his attempts to get Captain Watkinson, "a very gruff old Gentleman," to take some tobacco left by another of Pemberton's ships. He has not heard of the arrival of Pemberton's slave ships which should have done better had they arrived earlier. Carter has drawn two bill of exchange on him payable to George Braxton for slaves that Carter was forced to buy because of many deaths among his slaves during the winter.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. The draft is damaged along its left margin.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<note id="n2">[2] John Brett commanded Tucker's ship, the <hi rend="italics">Princess Amelia</hi> which had been commanded by a Captain Lawrence until he was drowned. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 9729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Russell commanded the <hi rend="italics">Portland,</hi> a vessel owned by Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 9729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Lawrence commanded the <hi rend="italics">Princess Amelia</hi>. When the ship arrived the previous year, Carter noted in his diary on December 22, 1726, that "Captn Lawrence drownd."</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Indian Creek lies at the eastern tip of Lancaster County at the northern side of Fleets Bay where it is "the boundary between" Northumberland and Lancaster counties "for most of its course." and runs inland roughly northwest towards today's Kilmarnock. It probably was 6 or 7 miles from "Corotoman" by the roads of Carter's time. (<cit><bibl n="B29">Miller. <title>Place-Names . . . . </title>p. 72.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] At this time, Britain was allied with France and Prussia against Spain and Austria, and the Spanish had laid siege to Gibralter; it was not successful. The conflict would end in 1729 with the treaty of Seville by which Britain obtained Gibralter. (<cit><bibl>J. H. Plumb. <title>England in the Eighteenth Century [1714-1815].</title> [Hammersmith, Middlesex: Penguin Books, 1953]. pp. 64-65.</bibl></cit>)</note>

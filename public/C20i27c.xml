<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Francis Chamberlayne and Francis
Sitwell, September 27, 1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to merchants Francis Chamberlayne and
Francis Sitwell, September 27, 1720, to send them more bills of
exchange resulting from the sale of a cargo of slaves that he and
Robert Tucker had undertaken on the merchants' behalf. He also sends
accounts of the sales of slaves sent to Westmoreland and Lancaster
counties, and concludes with the hope that "You will receive
Sattisfaction in what of her Affairs past under our Managemt." </p>

.</title> pp. 52-53.</bibl></cit> Wright misdated the letter as April
27, 1720, because the top half of the letter is extremely difficult
to read. There is a great deal of bleed-through from the text on the
reverse side of the letter book page as well as a hole in a portion
of the page.

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Francis Chamberlayne  (abt. 1667-1728) was from a 
Warwickshire family. His father was 
also a London merchant, and "Chamberlayne engaged in commerce
himself and may have been involved in the 
slave trade." He was quite wealthy, and represented New Shoreham in
Parliament at two different times, first 
as a Whig, and later as a Tory. (<cit><bibl>David Hayton, <hi

<note>The clerk who copied this document into the court order book used many abbreviations which have been expanded for the modern language version of this text. He also used a convention of the time of abbreviating a word and placing a horizontal line over it, or curling back the tail of the last stroke over it, to indicate that the word was to be expanded. Words with these conventions have been expanded silently in these transcript versions as there is no way of depicting such conventions in this software. The clerk also used the "fancy p" at the beginning of a word to stand for "per," "par," or "pro" as appropriate, and these uses have also been silently expanded.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] William Armistead (1671-1711) was born in Gloucester County and lived at "Hesse." His older sister, Judith, was Robert Carter's first wife. He married Anna, Daughter of Hancock Lee, Lee about 1693.

<note id="n2">[2] Elizabeth (Landon) Willis (1684-1719) was Carter's second wife by whom he had ten children. She had their last child, George, in 1718. See Smith  pp. 1-4 for a discussion of the background of the Landon family in England and Virginia, and of Betty's first marriage to Richard Willis.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] (1656-1701)  Darrett and Anita Rutman write of Richard Willis's position in the  power structure (justice, militia officer) of Middlesex County, and his growing wealth. "Just before his death in 1700 . . . [he] abandoned his old house of four rooms for one of six that also had a separate kitchen and dairy." As Willis married his third wife, <note n="EWC">Betty Landon</note> (1684-1719) shortly before, he probably anticipated bringing his bride to a fine new establishment.

<note id="n4">[4]   Jennifer Drobac has written, "Simply defined, a jointure 'was a property provision for [the] wife, made prior to marriage in lieu of dower." Henry Black, author of the standard law dictionary, defined dower as "the provision which the law makes for a widow out of the lands or tenements of her husband for her support."' In a review of Susan Staves's <title>Married Women's Separate Property in England 1660-1833</title>, Margaret A. Doody wrote: "In the older system that prevailed before the mid-seventeenth century, women had 'dower rights.' At common law, a widow was entitled to a life estate amounting to one-third of all the real property of which her husband had been the legal owner. Staves shows how such a provision came to be felt an unreasonable clog on an estate . . . The result was the invention of the 'jointure,' a settlement upon the wife if her husband predeceased her, as agreed upon in advance by prenuptial contract." (Jennifer Drobac.

He had a son of the same name as a Nicholas Wren Sr. was listed as one of the executors of Henry Bell (Nicholas Sr.'s father-in-law) recorded July 10, 1695.

<note id="n10">[10] The recording clerk had difficulty with this man's last name which may have been "Plover."

A John Plover was a witness to a <xref to="http://lawsondna.org/Media/virginiacounties/Old_Rappahannock.html">1673 power of attorney</xref> in Old Rappahannock County, and there was a ship captain of this name who appears in Virginia records.</note>

<note id="n11">[11] Several recorded instruments for the name William Clapham (Clappam) are included in Lancaster County court records. The most likely possibility seems to be that of the Clapham whose inventory was recorded October 1, 1656, as Thomas Carter, Nicholas Wren, and John Carter were listed as appraisers.

<note id="n14">[14]  The land mentioned in the agreement had been granted June 1, 1666, to David Miles, who bequeathed it to his wife, Martha, and daughter, Elizabeth. Elizabeth married Thomas Husbands and survived him. Her mother Martha married secondly Thomas Norris and outlived him. Robert Carter purchased November 30, 1695, 250 acres from Martha Norris, and Tobias Purcell had earlier bought 150 acres on February 5, 1689, land that Robert Carter acquired from Purcell in 1696.

<note id="n15">[15] No information has been found about John Bave and William Brownsford. Perhaps they were indentured servants to Robert Carter as clerks as he later would use clerks to witness instruments they had copied out for him.</note>

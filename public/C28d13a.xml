He reports that the tobacco crop is not as good this year as in the last, and sends first and second bills of exchange (not present).</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1]  James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose,</hi> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C30d15a.html">Carter to Pemberton,</xref> April 15, 1730.)</note>

<note id="n2">[2]   The <hi rend="italics">Leopard</hi> was a Liverpool ship commanded by Matthew Hayes in 1727-1728. (See Carter to Pemberton <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27l19b.html">December 19, 1727</xref>,  and <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C28b20a.html">February 21, 1728</xref>.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> was a ship owned by King and Queen County resident Samuel Smith; she was commanded by Thomas Price. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C28a22a.html">Carter to Samuel Smith</xref>, January 22, 1728.)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Liverpool</note>

<note id="n5">[5] There  were several vessels with this name. One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726/27. Carter's letters mention a Captain Brackhill in 1728, and Captain Loxum in 1733. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="6">[6] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship owned by merchant John Pemberton; she often carried slaves into the colony. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.

<note id="n7"> [7] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

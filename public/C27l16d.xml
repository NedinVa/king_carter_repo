<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Falconar, December 16, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant John Falconar, December 16, 1727, to defend the quality of the tobacco that he produces, noting that it is "an easy matter for a merchant to give a despicable character of a mans goods when he renders him but a low sale." He also complains that Falconar has not sent his goods but has held them to be sent in one of the merchant's own ships. Carter writes that he understands why Falconar cannot undertake training of one of Carter's sons, and even though they have different religious faiths, he will continue to patronize the merchant as long as his tobacco is sold well, his good are purchased, and he is treated fairly.</p>

The writing on the right margin of the obverse of the leaf (and the left of the reverse) are faded probably from water on the letter book's edge.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Falconar (d. <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27g24d.html">Carter's letter to Falconar </xref> of July 24 and August 22, 1727, for details about the payment of &pound;200 to him. See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C30d16b.html">Carter to William Dawkins,</xref> for Falconar's death date. <cit><bibl>Arthur Pierce Middleton. <title>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</title> Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Captain James Hopkins commanded the <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> in 1727-1728. He was then working for London merchant Robert Cary. He is mentioned in Carter's diary. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Marlborough</hi> was a vessel of 100 tons and 14 men, commanded by George Buckeridge (Buckbridge). In a letter to London merchant John Falconar<xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27g24d.html"> July 24,  1727,</xref> Carter refers to this vessel as "yor. Marlborrough."

<note id="n4">[4] Carter had written to Falconar <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27e16b.html">May 16, 1727</xref>, about placing his son Landon with the merchant as an apprentice to learn the trade.</note>

<note id="n5">[5] A Captain John Cobb commanded the <hi rend="italics">Willis</hi>, a ship of 300 tons with 20 men, in 1727-28. The ship was owned by merchants Haswell and Brooks which was a London firm.

<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, April 15, 1730, complaining about the  low prices received for his tobacco, the good ale Tucker had sent but the poor packing of it, the tobacco he is shipping, and requesting the merchant find Carter's mining company an experienced copper miner.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. That address as well as the  county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Russell commanded the <hi rend="italics">Portland,</hi> a vessel owned by Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker as is noted in a letter from <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27f28g.html">Carter to Tucker,</xref> June 28 and July 25, 1727. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 9729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

 <note id="n2"> [2] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2]   "The lowest grade [of tobacco] was known as lugs as early as 1686. . . ." (<cit><bibl>Philip A. Bruce. <title>Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century: An Inquiry into the Material Condition of the People, Based on Original and Contemporaneous Records.</title> [New York: MacMillan and Co., 1896], I:442 online at <xref to="Ext14">"Classics of American Colonial History."</xref> http://www.dinsdoc.com/bruce-1-7.htm</bibl></cit>) </note>

 <note id="n4">[4] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1728 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission was successful, and he was home in the colony by <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C29f02a.html">June 2, 1729</xref>, when Carter wrote to welcome him home.

<note id="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] John Shapley was made a justice in Northumberland County in 1725. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>,  4[1721-1739]: 82.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n7">[7] The Rappahannock</note>

 <note id="n8">[8]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company they named Frying Pan to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

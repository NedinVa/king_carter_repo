<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah and Richard Perry, 1717 December 10</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah and Richard Perry, 1717 December 10, 1717, noting that he will write more of Virginia politics in his next as there is to be an Assembly beginning March 4th, and that he had fallen from a horse, badly displacing some of the bone in his arm, which will keep him at home during the winter. He asks them to convey his "blessing" to his son John from whom he has not heard since John recovered from small pox; he hopes John "will learn his duty" to communicate more often.</p>

<p>Our news here is not extraordin<lb/>=ary. Some politicks there are on the <lb/>anvil, which my next
will more <lb/>particularly touch upon. We are <lb/>to have an assembly the fourth of <lb/>March. God
send us fair weather.</p>

<p>By a fall from a horse I had <lb/>the misfortune to sprain my wrist <lb/>and am <sic corr="sure">in
doubt</sic> some of the bones <lb/>are displaced, which I fear will <lb/>keep me a house=bird all this
<lb/>winter.</p>

<p>Pray my blessing to my son. I <lb/>have not had a <note target="n2"><sic corr="snip?">srip</sic></note> from him <lb/>since his 
recovery out of the Small Pox. <lb/>I hope he will learn his duty in <lb/>paying more  frequent respects to
a father <lb/>who has been so abundantly kind to <lb/>him&mdash;</p>

<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and state have been added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Richard Perry (d. 1720) was a partner with his father, Micajah, in the great London mercantile
firm of Perry and Lane. (<cit><bibl n="B22">Price. <title>Perry of London. . . . </title></bibl></cit>
)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The copyist has clearly written "srip" but this word does not appear in the <title>Oxford English Dictionary.</title> Presumably he miscopied from the letter book, possibly for "snip."  Carter's complaint of not having received a letter from John is clear.</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain [Charles] Broadwater, December 28, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Captain [Charles] Broadwater, December 28, 1723, to inform him that he cannot issue a warrant for the land that Broadwater desires on Dogue Run because George Mason and Robert Alexander have already obtained warrants in the area. He does send Broadwater a warrant for use in case Broadwater can identify land he would like in the area.</p>

<note>The name of Carter's home, the county, and colony have been added to this unheaded draft.</note>


<note id="n1">[1] Charles Broadwater (d. 1733) was described by Fairfax Harrison as "a merchant mariner [who] had been established in the Potomac freshes for a decade when he died in 1733." (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title> p. 413.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] George Mason III (c. 1690-1735), justice, sheriff, burgess, and county lieutenant of Stafford County, father of the constitutional theorist. (<cit><bibl n="B24">Copeland and MacMaster, <title>The Five George Masons.</title> pp. 50-86</bibl></cit>; and <cit><bibl>George Harrison Sanford King, <title>The Register of Overwharton Parish Stafford County Virginia 1723-1758 And Sundry Historical and Genealogical Notes</title>. [Fredericksburg, VA: privately printed, 1961.]</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] This probably is present Dogue Creek in Fairfax County, lying along the southwestern side of what was once called Mt. Vernon Neck, near Mt. Vernon. "Dogue Creek is a tidal tributary of the Potomac River in Fairfax County, Virginia, named for the Doeg Indians." (<cit><bibl>Alexandria Drafting Company. <title>Regional Northern Virginia.</title> [Alexandria, VA: Alexandria Drafting Company, 2002.]. pp. 23, 29;  </bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl>Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogue_Creek. 12/8/2010.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Pimmots (Pimmits) Run is located in today's Fairfax County, and Wikipedia's description of its meandering route is good:  [It] "runs from Fairfax County to the Potomac River at Chain Bridge in the Arlingwood neighborhood of Arlington County." There is a neighborhood and a park bearing the Pimmits name along its route. Wikipedia also notes, "The stream was named for John Pimmit who in 1675 was an overseer for William Fitzhugh (1651-1701). John was naturalized a citizen in 1679, and died by drowning in 1688-1689. He was survived by three children." It is also stated that a citation was needed for this information. It almost certainly was taken from Fairfax Harrison's <cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William,</title></bibl></cit> pages 68 and 75. (<cit><bibl>Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimmit_Run. 12/8/2010</bibl></cit>; and<cit><bibl>Alexandria Drafting Company. <title>Regional Northern Virginia.</title> [Alexandria, VA: Alexandria Drafting Company, 2002.]. pp. 20-21. </bibl></cit> )</note><lb/>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton and Company, December 19, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchants John Pemberton and Company, December 19, 1727, concerning the concluding details of a slave sale that he has conducted in the colony for the firm, sending a bill of lading for tobacco received in exchange for slaves, and a bill of exchange. He has concluded not to send more of the firm's tobacco on an available ship because the merchants may have already made arrangements for its shipment.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose,</hi> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </note>

<note id="n2">[2] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship often carrying slaves owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729. (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 18, n. 23</bibl></cit>; Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15; and Carter to William Dawkins, June 28, July 26, and August 22, 1727, for Denton's first name.)</note>

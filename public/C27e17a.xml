<title>Letter from Robert Carter to James Bradley, May 17, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant James Bradley, May 17, 1727, reporting the arrival of Bradley's ship, the <hi rend="italics">Welcome,</hi> and of letters he has received from the merchant. He was disappointed with the sales of his tobacco, but notes that they were about what he had received from others. He is sending tobacco on board the <hi rend="italics">Providence</hi> and he sends a bill of exchange for the duties. He reminds Bradley that he wishes to find a place for his son Landon as an apprentice to   learn the Virginia trade, and hopes that Bradley will change his mind about taking Landon.</p>

<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in this letter, Bradley owned the <hi rend="italics">Welcome,</hi> but little information about Bradley has been located.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The 140 ton <hi rend="italics">Welcome</hi> was owned by London merchant James Bradley as Carter notes here. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1727. (<cit><bibl>Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Thomas Woodward commanded the <hi rend="italics">Providence</hi> during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1727. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194 and 195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Landon Carter (1710-1778) was Carter's seventh child by his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis. Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary. (<cit><bibl n="B30">Greene. <title>The Diary of Colonel Landon Carter. . . .</title></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Thomas Lee (1690-1750) was the son of Richard Lee II, and nephew of Edmund Jenings; he would build "Stratford," and succeed Carter on the Council. (<cit><bibl>Burton J. Hendrick. <title>The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family.</title> [Boston: Little Brown, 1935]. pp. 48, 51, etc.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] Francis Lightfoot had been naval officer for the upper district of James River until his death; a new officer was appointed in February 1727. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:160. </bibl></cit>)</note>

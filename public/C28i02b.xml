<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, September 2, 1728, to inform him that he has been unable to ship tobacco in "Mr. Cheaps Ship" because she was full when she reached his house. He also reports several bills of exchange that he has lately drawn on Stark, and in a post script dated September 13th reports another.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Mr. Cheap has not been identified. He may have been a factor on a ship commanded by someone else since Carter does not refer to him as "captain."</note>

<note id="n3">[3] John Tayloe (1687-1747) of Mt. Airy, Richmond County, who served as justice, burgess, colonel of militia, and as a member of the Council after 1732. (<cit><bibl n="B31">Ryland. <title>Richmond County Virginia. . . . </title> pp. 115-16.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] The <hi rend="italics">Martha</hi>  was commanded by a Captain Dunlop; see Carter to Richard Oswald &amp; Company 1729 August 11.</note>

<note id="n5">[5] No information has been found about captains Sharp and Raymond.</note>

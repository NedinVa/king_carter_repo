<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain [Thomas] Hooper, December 28, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Captain [Thomas] Hooper, December 28, 1723, chastising his friend and business associate for his failure to notify him that Captain Charles Broadwater wanted land on Dogue Run. Colonel George Mason and Robert Alexander applied to Carter first and were given warrants which makes it impossible for him to give Broadwater a warrant in that area. He also lets Hooper know that he expects Hooper to write more often, and to pay more attention to making surveys for Carter's own land entries.</p>

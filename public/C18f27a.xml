<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Robert Burridge, 1718 June
27</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Robert Burridge, a merchant in Lyme
Regis, Dorset, England, on June 27, 1718, reporting a draft on
Burridge to John Parker, and reminding Burridge that he had asked
Carter to buy some tobacco for him. Now he has written to Carter
complaining about the high prices in Virginia for tobacco, and Carter
notes "Indeed there hath been no such time produced the like within
my memory." The Scots merchants are buying up "most ordinary, meanest
stuff in the country " at these extraordinary prices. Carter
continues that he has not had the opportunity of shipping tobacco to
Burridge this year but will next if a Lyme ship presents itself. He
asks Burridge to pressure his brother John (a London merchant and
member of Parliament) to account to Carter for 9 hogheads sent him 2
years earlier. He concludes that Burridge complains at length about
Daniel McCarty who, in turn, complains about Burridge. He does not
know where the truth is, but hopes "you may be so much friends to
your own peace to 
compromise your differences among yourselves," and counsels that the
only ones who gain in lawsuits are the lawyers. </p>

<p>My last advised you of a draft <lb/>I had made on you to <name

for <lb/>&pound;50. In one of your's this year you <lb/>advise me to

of the <lb/>high prices given here.  
Indeed there <lb/><sic corr="has ">hath </sic> been no such time

prices and the <lb/>Scotch are still 
laying up all the refuse <lb/>and trash they can meet with. what the
<lb/><sic corr="mystery">misterie</sic> of their trade is I don't 
<lb/>know; but sure I am were we to give <lb/>these prices for such
goods we should <lb/>never see our 
principal by a great deal.</p>  
 
<p>No freight this year within my  
 
<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/> 
reach <sic corr="has ">hath </sic> offered to your <note

must not thence conclude <lb/>I

<lb/>I intend to be at it again upon 
<lb/>the first freight I meet with.</p> 
 
<p>Your brother <note target="n3">John</note>, the <sic

man, stands in my debt for <lb/>nine Hhds of Tobo I sent him two
<lb/>years ago&mdash;would never yet

can by no means set your horses <lb/>together.  You complain
mightily <lb/>against him and he is as big 
with <lb/>complaints of you.  Who is in the <lb/>wrong I can't tell.
One story is <lb/>always good till 
another is heard. <lb/>I wish you may be so much <lb/>friends to
your own peace to <lb/>compromise 
your differences  among <lb/>yourselves.  Few get so much in the
<lb/>end in going into contentions of 
<lb/>Law, set aside the Lawyers and <lb/>Officers. But this is none
of my <lb/>business.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-
Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,
Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently
there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now
lost&mdash;from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. As
they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained.</note>
 
<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have been
added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>

<note id="n2">[2] Burridge was located in Lyme Regis, Dorset.</note> 
 
<note id="n3">[3] John Burridge (1681?-1753), brother of Robert, was
a merchant in London trading 
primarily "to Guinea and the West Indies." It is not surprising that
RC could not obtain the sales report 
and money he mentions in this letter; in 1717, John Burridge's
estate had been seized by the Crown for 
non-payment of duties  on wine. John Burridge represented Lyme in
Parliament from 1710-1728. (<cit><bibl n="B6">Sedgwick. <title>The

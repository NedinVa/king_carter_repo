<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, July 23,
1720, thanking him for a shipment of shoes which has not arrived and
which may have been sent to York River in error. He chides Evans for
not selling his tobacco at 11 pence, and closes with comments on the
South Sea stock investments and the actions of Parliament about
it.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter refers to the scandal of
the value of the stock of the South Sea and other companies which
wild speculation had driven enormously high in June 1720, and which
was nearly worthless several months later. Many fortunes were made
and lost. Perhaps the most succesful speculator was Sir Robert
Walpole who made a fortune, retired, and then was called to save the
nation as prime minister, a post he held from 1721 until 1742.

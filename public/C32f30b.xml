<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry, June 1732</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant  Alderman [Micajah] Perry, June 1732, to alert him to renewed attacks upon the proprietary in the current assembly, and to send a record of "their votes" as he has to Thomas Lord Fairfax. He relates the problems ship masters are having in finding complete cargoes, and hopes this will mean a better market for tobacco.</p>

<p>I writ to you by the <note target="n1"><name type="ship"><sic corr="Rebecca">Rebeca</sic></name></note> at some Length about my <note n="TF">Lord <lb/>
Fairfax's</note> Affairs. The Burgesses are now making a fresh attack against <lb/>
his Lordship's grant as you will see by their Votes, which I have thought it my <lb/>
Duty by this first Opportunity to transmit to his Lordship <abbr expan="that">tht</abbr> he may be upon <lb/>
his Guard in the Defence of his Estate; &amp; I send also a Copy of these Votes for your <lb/>
Perusal. The Money they voted for <sic corr="soliciting">solliciting</sic> their Petition in the Former <lb/>
Session was disallowed by the Council; but whether it will meet with the <lb/>
same Fate now I cannot take upon me to say. I expect the Gentlemen of <lb/>
our Revenue will leave no Stone unturned to carry their Point for <lb/>
Reasons I have formerly mentioned to you.</p>

<p>Captain Bradby of the <note target="n2"><name type="ship">Spotswood</name></note> <sic corr="has">hath</sic> lately visited me &amp; makes <lb/>
a heavy Complaint of the Little Hopes he is in of getting his Ship near Loaded, &amp;

advised that the Ships will not be near loaded in James River; <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr><del>Malbon</del> <add place="supralinear">Bradby</add> <lb/> tells me he <sic corr="has">hath</sic> <sic corr="written">writ</sic> these stories to You both by the <sic corr="Rebecca">Rebeca</sic> &amp; by <note target="n3">Brooks.</note> I have <lb/>
done all in my Power towards Loading your ships. Seabrook they say will <lb/>
get full. What <note target="n4">Dove</note> will be able to do he <abbr expan="cannot">can't</abbr> yet tell. Your chartered Ship <lb/>
takes a great deal away from him. We flatter ourselves these Things will <lb/>

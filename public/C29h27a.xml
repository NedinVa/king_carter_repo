The Rest of the gang may very well get the Fodder <corr resp="editor">[ . . .]</corr> <lb/>
and I think if 3 or 4 of the best of mill hands <corr resp="editor">[ . . .]</corr> <lb/>
went to Assit them, for Six weeks or two months, <corr resp="editor">[ . . .]</corr> <lb/>
there would be no great damage done to that plantation <corr resp="editor">[th]</corr>e <lb/>

I am in hopes your dam is so near finished that we may <lb/>
get some from thence, or at least that there is Stuff enough <lb/>
at your house to make Some, &amp; that the Carpenters may be <lb/>
Spared to make as many as we Shall want, they may be made <lb/>
at home &amp; Sent over in a <sic corr="Flat">Flatt</sic> &amp; this to be done with all Expedition</p>

<p>The other Difficulty is to have a person always to be with these <lb/>

-nient for Pasquet always to be there, &amp; it will be Necessary tht. he be wth. <lb/>
his other people often, in Carrying on the plantation Work, to remedy <lb/>
this I propose that each of the other overseers Wright Madeson &amp; O<corr resp="editor">[li]</corr>ver <lb/>
each take his day to be there one day in the Week, &amp; that they take <lb/>
turns one of them to be there two days, &amp; Pasquet to attend two days <lb/>

The first page of this letter has suffered considerable damage including large sections missing along both margins. There is some damage to the second and third pages as well.</note>

<note>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note>The addresse's name, if present on the draft, has been lost due to damage to the sheet. The editor believes that internal evidence indicates that the letter was addressed to William Camp; see footnote #1.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.

<note id="n4">[4] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jenings' estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. Carter obviously felt its mill would be a good acquisition .(<cit><bibl><xref to="https://archive.org/stream/williammarycolle02tyle#page/n547/mode/2up/search/271">"Notes and Queries."</xref> <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278, now available through the Internet Archive.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] According to the <hi rend="italics">Oxford English Dictionary,</hi> "weast" is an obsolete meaning of "west." Accordingly, what Carter meant by the use of this word is unclear.</note>

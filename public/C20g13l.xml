<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Edward Tucker, July 13,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, July 13,
1720, concerning a bill of exchange, a shipment of 30 hogsheads of
tobacco on board the <hi rend="italics">Brimpton,</hi> Virginia
expectations of a good market
for tobacco with the Spanish and French markets now open, and smaller
numbers of outport ships in the colony. He had expected to ship more
tobacco by the <hi rend="italics">Brimpton,</hi> but Captain Russel
had so much tobacco to
carry he was glad not to have to take more of Carter's which went to
London. He adds that he has drawn a bill of exchange for &pound;100
to Edmund Jenings, complains mildly that he has not received current
accounts from Tucker, doubles his order for wood flooring blocks, and
repeats an order for Southampton cyder. He concludes with orders for
good white wine and ale, having given up drinking red because of his
gout, and tells Tucker that Captain Russel will give him the Virginia
news.</p>

"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for

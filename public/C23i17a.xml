<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain John Hyde and Company, September 17, 17[23]</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Captain John Hyde and Company, September 17, 17[23], to remind the merchants of a bill of exchange reported in an earlier letter, and relating his decision to order some "selling Goods." He reports the poor crop across the colony and in Maryland, and expresses his hope that the tobacco already sent to England will fetch good prices. In a post script, he reports the arrival of the firm's ship the <hi rend="italics">Providence,</hi> Capt. Woodward, with a load of salt which Carter notes he will assist the master in selling.</p>

There is a nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The amount of the bill was given in Carter's letter to Hyde 1723 August 8.</note>

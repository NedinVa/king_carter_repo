<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Carter, July 13, 1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his son John, then in London studying
law, on July 13, 1720, complaining at length about John's expenses,
particularly in persuading Micajah Perry to advance him funds beyond
his allowance. He states that if John deceives him again about the
expenses, he will no longer accept John's word about the management
of his affairs in London. He continues by refuting John's claim that
John Randolph has maligned John, and adds that Randolph never wore
better clothes that he has observed although his acquaintance with
Randolph is slight. Randolph's politics and his were so opposed,
Randolph being "a rank Torey a Proud, humble Parasite a fawning
Sycophant to his Patron," that he had not hired Randolph again after
a year of retaining him, and now finds Randolph involved in almost
all cases he has lost. Robert continues that his lawsuit against
Thomas Wise should soon be concluded, and that he will write
separately concering "Mr. Lee's Settlemt. &amp; Sr. Robt. Raymond's 
opinion upon the Case." He writes John that "Mr. Cary's
Lawsuit is not Yett determin'd" and gives some details of the case,
and notes that some poor familys that "whose Ancestors before them
have liv'd &amp; Dyed in quiet possession of these Lands" are likely
to be hurt by the suit, adding that he has a closer claim to the
lands than the person from whom Cary acquired  because they had
belonged to his niece. He instructs John to visit Cary and make him
acquainted with these facts, reporting that he had made offers to
Cary through his lawyers to buy the lands in question, and directing
John to keep in close contact, pressing Cary for his "Lowest
Demands." He concludes by criticising John for not mentioning his
brothers who are in England at school, and reports that the family is
well.</p>

Letter Book, 1720 July-1721 July, BR 227, Huntington Library, Art
Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. Printed:
<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . .
.</title> pp. 7-10.</bibl></cit></note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to merchants
abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] RC and <name type="person">Thomas Wise</name> had
"traded with each other in tobacco and bills of exchange between 1707
and 1717," but Wise "neglected his duty in returning those bills that
were protested." Carter sued Wise in England to recover his money,
and he won &pound;180. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 10147 describing
C24/1398 part 1, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert H. Small
Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</bibl></cit> and
letter of August 19, 1723, RC to Micajah Perry.)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Sir Robert Raymond, later Lord Chief Justice, was
Attorney General in 1720. He was regarded as the foremost lawyer of
his day.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Mr. Cary may have been Robert Cary (1685-1751), a
member of a British family of merchants who had many Virginia
connections. See <bibl n="A6"> Price. "Who Was John Norton? A Note on
. . .  Some Eighteenth-Century London Virginia Firms."</bibl> for an
extensive discussion of the Cary family.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Elizabeth (Carter) Lloyd (1675-1693) was RC's
brother John's only child. Elizabeth married John Lloyd in 1691, and
was dead of measles by November 1693. John appointed managers of the
estate in 1699 in Essex County, and returned to England the next year
as he had inherited land there. Elizabeth inherited from her mother,
Elizabeth Hull, also an only child, all of her grandfather John
Hull's property. </note>

<note id="n5">[5] Probably Richard Hull of Northumberland County who
died in 1717.</note>

<note id="n6">[6] John Carter's younger brothers, Robert (1704-
1732), Charles (1707-1764), and Landon (1710-1778), were then in
England for their education. (<cit><bibl n="B30">Greene, <title>The
Diary of Colonel Landon Carter of Sabine Hall,1752-1778</title>,
3.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n7">[7] John's sister Judith (1695-c.1750) who married
Mann Page of "Rosewell" in 1718.</note>

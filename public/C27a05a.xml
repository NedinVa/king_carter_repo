<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Peter Leheup, January 5, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Peter Leheup, Virginia's agent in England, January 5, 1727, to thank him for his offer of assistance concerning his salary while administering the colony, and expressing his support for the liquor law recently passed by the Assembly. He closes by noting that he believes the merchants are attempting to harrass the colonists "out of our Estates by loading us with Interest upon Interest," which he believes can best be avoided by not getting in their debt.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> CO5/1320, ff. 118, Public Record Office, London, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. This is the recipient's copy, signed by Carter with his usual large and prominent signature, indicated here by the use of bold italics.  Leheup turned the letter over to the Board of Trade among whose records it was found. Much later a rubber stamp reading "Her Majesty's State Paper Office" was applied.  It is endorsed: "Recd March 4: | Read Do: 10: | }1726/7."</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Peter Leheup, an English Treasury clerk, was Virginia's  and other colonies' agent in England for some years. He was related by marriage to the Prime Minister's brother who was secretary of the Treasury. His influence would be greater near the end of Carter's life. (<cit><bibl n="B22">Price. <title>Perry of London. . . . </title> pp. 75-77, 80, 83.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Thomas Pelham-Holles, the 1st Duke of Newcastle, was Secretary of State in the Walpole government; Richard L. Morton notes that the duke carried on a policy of "`saluatory neglect' of the colonies which lasted until the Seven Years' War." (<cit><bibl n="B17">Morton. <title>Colonial Virginia.</title> p. 506.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Williamsburg</note>

<note id="n4">[4] A moiety is "a half, one of two equal parts."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] This entire paragraph has been underlined, presumably by Leheup, to draw attention to Carter's comment on the liquor law. See Hening for the text of the act entitled "An Act for Laying a duty on Liquor" which would have sent &pound;200 per year of the proceeds of this duty to the College of William and Mary. (<cit><bibl>William Waller Hening. <title>The Statutes at Large; being A Collection of All the Laws of Virginia. . . .</title>  [Richmond: privately printed, 1820. Facsimile reprint, 1969.] 4:143-150.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] See the discussion on pages 69-71 in <cit><bibl n="B22">Price. <title>Perry of London. . . . </title></bibl></cit> over the debts to <note n="MP">Micajah Perry</note> accrued by William Randolph (d. 1711) and the later efforts of Perry's executrix and grandsons to collect the money due after the senior Perry's death in 1721. The case had been appealed from Virginia where the Perrys had lost to the Privy Council which found in the Perrys' favor in 1725  As Price writes, the last sentence in this letter, "The best remedy will be not to get into their Debts," was "not sanctimonious cant," by Carter "for . . . he had a healthy credit balance with the Perrys even if few others did."</note><lb/>

<note id="n7">[7] Carter probably uses an older meaning of the word "worry" which was "to kill (a person or animal) by compressing the throat; to strangle." (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title></bibl></cit>)

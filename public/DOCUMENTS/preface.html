Robert "King" Carter's Correspondence and Diary: the Texts and
Transcription Policy
</h2>
<h3>
<i>By</i> Edmund Berkeley, Jr.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
The texts consist chiefly of nine volumes of outgoing letters,
1701-1710, and 1720-1732, drafted by one or another of several clerks or
occasionally by one of his sons, from Carter's dictation or general
directions. In addition there are: a one-volume diary, 1723-1728, in
Carter's hand; a dozen or more recipients' copies of letters; a slightly
larger number of nineteenth-century transcripts for letters dated
between 1717 and 1719 copied from a letter book not extant; and a few
letters addressed to Carter. No texts have been found for 1711-1714, and
there are only a few recipient's copies of letters in 1725-1726.  Thus,
this project deals with texts written out at Carter's derection by a
variety of persons in addition to the text of his diary in his hand.

</p><p>
Approximately 800 letters survive, and of these, some 750 are drafts
found in the letter books. These texts are reasonably easy to read, the
major problems coming from the variety of handwritings and styles of
punctuation and capitalization of the clerks with the additional
complication of a number of texts available only in nineteenth-century
transcripts. The disorder in chronology of the letters is considerable
in some of the letter books because the clerks apparently would pick up
the nearest book when Carter was ready to dictate. In this edition,
strict chronological order has been adhered to, with diary entries
preceding letter texts of the same date. If there is more than one
letter with the same date, the letters are in order alphabetically by
the recipients' last names.

</p><p>
Of the surviving recipients' copies of his letters (generally written
out by clerks and signed by Carter), perhaps three or four are
duplicated in the letter books.  Many of the extant letters are
addressed to merchants or other persons in Britain, and Carter followed
the colonial practice of sending duplicate letters by different ships.
Only one such example survives. The Huntington Library has two
recipient's texts of the letter of June 30, 1724, to Colonel William
Cage, both of them written by clerks, signed by Carter and sealed with
his arms, one sent<q>"per the Princess Carolina, Captain Holladay,</q>
and the other <q>per the Spotswood, Captain Bagnell.</q>

</p><p>
The diary covers the years 1723-1728, and is in very bad physical
condition, the edges of many pages having flaked off.  It is difficult
to read at times due to Carter's carelessness and his habit of
abbreviating words. Frank Berkeley wrote of the diary that it is
<q>highly telegraphic in style, almost as terse as shorthand at times in
its frugality of expression, and almost totally lacking in
punctuation.</q> Carter's spelling was inconsistent at best, and
entirely freewheeling at its worst. He was voluble only in regard to his
health in this diary, and often frustratingly refers to his <q>other
book</q> where details of happenings apparently were recorded. The poor
physical condition of the diary with its numerous holes and tears in the
text have made the use of large numbers of square brackets in the
transcript necessary.

</p><p>
The following rules for transcription and for dates have been used:


</p><p>
The spelling, grammar, capitalization, and punctuation of the original texts have been followed
insofar as possible, given the extreme difficulty of duplicating some of the conventions of
eighteenth-century handwriting.

</p><p> 
Superior letters and clear abbreviations are retained. When an abbreviation is unclear, it is 
expanded with square brackets to indicate editorial additions.

</p><p>  
The thorn is expanded to "th" in all instances. 

</p><p>  
The various "tailed P" symbols used for "per,"  "pro," etc., are silently expanded as appropriate. 

</p><p>  
The ampersand is retained throughout.

</p><p>  
Dashes used as flourishes at the end of sentences are retained.

</p><p>  
All dates are given Old Style (Julian Calendar) but with the year beginning January 1st rather than
March 25th; the virgule and numbers for the old year are dropped silently.

</p><p>
Contracted words over which the clerks placed a tilde or straight line have been silently expanded.
Carter's clerks used a stylized abbreviation&mdash;"hhds"&mdash; for the word <q>hogsheads</q> in
which the tail of the <q>d</q> was not only swept up and to the left, as was common at the time, but
was then circled down and back across the three letters and down to form the terminal <q>s.</s>
Because this abbreviation seems to incorporate a tilde, the abbreviation <q>hhds</q> has been expanded
silently when the tilde is present.

</p><p>
Carter often dictated postscripts to letters and they are not necessarily beneath the letter to which
they pertain. Such postscripts are placed chronologically by the date they were dictated if present;
undated postscripts are added to the letter to which they refer if it can be determined. If the letter cannot
be identified, the undated postscript is given a tentative date determined by its place in the letter book.
Notes are given in the latter two cases.

<h3>LETTERS CONCERNING THE ESTATE OF RALPH WORMELEY</h3> 
</center>

<p> The earliest letters of Robert Carter's that have been located
&mdash fifty-three items dated between 1701 and 1710 &mdash concern the
estate of his brother-in-law, Ralph Wormeley (1650-1701), member of the
Council and Secretary of State of Virginia, who lived in very grand
style at <place>"Rosegill"</place> <place> Middlesex County </place>, on
the Rappahannock River. Carter had married Judith, and Wormeley
Elizabeth, the daughters of <person>John Armistead</person> of <place>
Gloucester County </place>.

</p><p> Wormeley, second of that name in Virginia, left two sons, Ralph
(ca. 1681-1714) and John (1689-1727), and named them his executors.
Because his sons were minors at the time of his death, his dear friends
and relations, <person> Edmund Jenings </person>, Robert Carter, Thomas
and <person> Gawin Corbin </person>, and <person> Edwin Thacker
</person>, who were asked in Wormeley's will to aid and assist his sons
in their duties, actually assumed control of the estate.  All the
trustees were planters but <person> Thomas Corbin </person> who had
become a merchant in <place>London</place>. Carter was responsible for
the Wormeley estates on the Rappahannock while Jenings supervised those
on the York River near his home, "Ripon Hall."

</p><p> Personal relationships between Wormeley's dear friends were
complicated. Wormeley and the Corbins were first cousins as their
mothers were sisters, Alice and Agatha Eltonhead. A third Eltonhead
sister, Eleanor, was Robert Carter's father's second (of five) wife.
Gawin Corbin was also Wormeley's son-in-law, having married his daughter
Katherine. Edmund Jenings was married to another daughter, Frances.
Edwin Thacker was a cousin of Wormeley's through the Eltonheads.

</p><p> Extracts from Carter's letters concerning the estate were
published in the <bibl id="A21"><title>William and Mary
Quarterly</title></bibl> in 1909,and were mentioned in an earlier
article in the <bibl id="A20"><title>Virginia Magazine of History and
Biography</title></bibl>. Both articles referred to the volume
containing the originals as one used chiefly to record processioners'
returns for Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County; the volume was then
in the Lancaster County courthouse.  Robert Carter was a vestryman of
this parish and apparently had custody of the volume. Care of his
friend's family would have been a religious duty to Carter, and he had
his clerks use the volume to record copies of his letters concerning the
Wormeley estate. The volume was located in Archives Research Services,
Library of Virginia, Richmond, where it is described as: Church Records,
Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County, Processioners' Returns,
1711-1783, and Wormeley Estate Papers, 1701-1710 (Acc. No. 30126).

<note id="n7">[7] Jennifer Drobac has written, "Simply defined, a jointure 'was a property provision for [the] wife, made prior to marriage in lieu of dower." Henry Black, author of the standard law dictionary, defined dower as "the provision which the law makes for a widow out of the lands or tenements of her husband for her support." In a review of Susan Staves's Married Women's Separate Property in England 1660-1833 , Margaret A. Doody wrote: "In the older system that prevailed before the mid-seventeenth century, women had 'dower rights.' At common law, a widow was entitled to a life estate amounting to one-third of all the real property of which her husband had been the legal owner. Staves shows how such a provision came to be felt an unreasonable clog on an estate . . . The result was the invention of the 'jointure,' a settlement upon the wife if her husband predeceased her, as agreed upon in advance by prenuptial contract." (Jennifer Drobac. "The 'Perfect' Jointure: Its Formulation After the Statute of Uses." 19 <title>Cambrian Law Review.</title> 26 [1988], p. 26; and <title>Eighteenth-Century Studies</title>. 28[ 1 Autumn, 1994] p. 156.)</note><lb/>

<note id="n25">[25] According to a variety of sources on the web, French falls were a type of high buff leather boots with a wide top that was turned over forming a cuff around the leg. P.A. Bruce wrote in his classic <title>Economic History of Virginia . . .,</title>  "The Assembly had, in 1660, adopted rules . . .  Each county was instructed to erect a tan-house and to employ tanners, carriers, and shoemakers. There was appointed for each house an overseer, who was directed to receive all hides brought in, paying two pounds of tobacco for each pound of hide. To the persons  presenting hides he was required to sell plain shoes at the rate of thirty pounds a pair. French falls of the largest size were to be sold to such persons at the rate of thirty-five pounds a pair, whilst those of the smallest were to be sold at twenty pounds."

BILL OF EXCHANGE <note id="n"> [] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (<cit><bibl><xref to="Ext6">"Dictionary of  Financial Scam Terms,"</xref> 8/22/2005</bibl></cit>)</note>

As with all financial documents, the source, i.e. the drawer or issuer of the bill of exchange, must be carefully investigated.  If it is a bank, then the bank must be contacted to verify the authenticity of the document, and the creditworthiness of the bank must be established through independent research.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a private party, then the risk depends on the creditworthiness of the drawer.

CHANEY  <note id="">[]  According to the <title>Oxford English Dictionary,</title> "chaney" was an old dialect term for   "china." From Linda Baumgarten, curator of textiles and costumes at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the editor has learned, "The curtains were made from a type of textile known as 'cheney, cheyney, or china' in the 17th and 18th centuries. This fabric was a wool worsted textile, relatively fine quality, though not as expensive as silk. The textiles called cheney were sometimes embossed with a moire or 'watered' pattern to increase their resemblance to silk. See Florence Montgomery, <title>Textiles in America, 1650-1870</title> (New York: WW Norton, a Winterthur Book, n. d.), p. 199."

owned some slaves, but had to sell them in 1730 to satisfy a debt to William Robertson, and generally seems to have had little success in living within his means.

From her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax had consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Proprietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.

The Encyclopedia Britannica Online notes,"Men also wore French falls, a 
buff leather boot with a high top wide enough to be crushed down. After 
1660 the jackboot . . . replaced the French falls." However, a 
knowledgeable staff member at Colonial Williamsburg has emailed me that 
French falls, while remaining a mystery, were definitely not a boot but 
were something more than a shoe, and that they were worn by both sexes.


FRENCH FALLS  <note id="n">[] According to a variety of sources on the web including the <title>Encyclopedia Britannica Online, </title>French falls were a type of high buff leather boots with a wide top that was turned over forming a cuff around the leg. P.A. Bruce wrote in his <title>Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century</title> on <xref to="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?u=1&num=title&seq=492&view=image&size=100&id=uc1.32106006322363&q1=boots">page 482</xref> of Vol. II,  "The Assembly had, in 1660, adopted rules . . .  Each county was instructed to erect a tan-house and to employ tanners, carriers, and shoemakers. There was appointed for each house an overseer . . . To the persons presenting hides he was required to sell plain shoes at the rate of thirty pounds [of tobacco] a pair. French falls of the largest size were to be sold to such persons at the rate of thirty-five pounds [of tobacco] a pair, whilst those of the smallest were to be sold at twenty pounds."  A knowledgeable staff member at Colonial Williamsburg has emailed the editor "The main puzzlement is, that French Falls were made for men, women, and children, and for well over 100 years.  No one can fathom any known style or type of footwear that fits that description with certainty, at that price range, that's not slippers. The leading UK footwear historian, June Swann, has never found a definitive answer as to what they were either.  Maybe one day we'll figure it out."

A tierce is one/third of a hogshead, while a barrel is typically half a hogshead.  Two hogsheads make a tun. Likewise a hogshead of tobacco started out at about 500 pounds in the 1630s.  At that time four hogsheads were rated as a ton of freight -- which was just about right.  But over time the size of the hogshead was increased and the  amount of tobacco prized . . .  into it  increased so that by the Revolution a typical hogshead weighed nearly 1300  pounds.  While we're on the subject of confusing measures, the weight of the container -- referred to as the tare -- also varied from barrel to barrel  and hogshead to hogshead.  So in practice you always needed to know both the  gross weight and the net weight of a container and its content to be sure of what you were paying for goods and what you paid for packaging.

A Virginia hogshead after 1705 was 4 8 inches high and 30 inches at its widest diameter.  When first introduced it rarely was prized to more than 800 pounds of tobacco, but by the Revolution the 1200-1300 pound range was quite common.  The increase was achieved by the more rigorous compression (prizing) of the tobacco.  Obviously the moisture content of the tobacco was critical, as was the rate at which the compression weight was added.  If you did it to fast, you simply turned the tobacco to pulp as the juices were latterly squeezed out of the leaves.

The store operation evidently continued, for his ships made the annual voyage into the 1760s. The property was acquired in 1767 by James Ritchie &amp; Co. of Glasgow; but How was back in Spotsylvania in the 1770s pursuing debtors." (<cit><bibl>Paula S. Felder.

JAMES MONROE LIBRARY:  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts in the Minor-Blackford papers are nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- now lost -- from which an unknown copiest recorded some texts. As they are the only ones extant, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copist used rows of the letter "x" to indicate material that he did not copy from the letter book. The text above was transcribed from a dictated text made by the editor in March1982 in which he did not note the line breaks made by the 19th-century copyist in preparing his copy from the original letter book.

SCOTS MERCHANTS  <note id="n">[] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.

TOBACCO, INLAND SALES: <note id="n">[] Because English law allowed an English purchaser of imported tobacco to apply for rebates of the impost, or duty, if the tobacco was exported from the country, Carter probably expected a discount on the charges on his tobacco sold to English merchants, or inland sales. </note>


TOBACCO LAW 1713 <note id="n">[] Governor Alexander Spotswood had gotten through the General Assembly in 1713 an act "for preventing frauds in Tobacco payments And for the better Improveing the Staple of Tobacco." Among other provisions (such as the establishment of tobacco inspections houses and of inspectors of tobacco), this law prohibited the stemming of tobacco. There was immediate opposition to the law, but Dodson in his biography of Spotswood notes that the lieutenant governor had the power of appointment of the tobacco inspectors, and "twenty-seven burgesses, a clear  majority, were tobacco agents" in 1714, which helped defeat amendments to the act that were brought up at that session. The colonial opposition together with opposition from the English merchants led to the repeal of the act in 1717; the news was announced in Virginia on November 12.

Cable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period.

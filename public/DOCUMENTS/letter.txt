In connection with an online edition of the Diary, Correspondence and Papers of Robert "King" Carter (1663-1732) of Virginia, 1701-1732 (http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/) I am attempting to find a description of footwear known as "French falls." This term appears in the inventory of his estate (November 1733) on which I am presently working. French falls were in common use in the colony, and the assembly in 1660 had enacted legislation requiring each county to establish a tan house and setting prices for footwear: "French falls of the largest size were to be sold to such persons at the rate of thirty-five pounds [of tobacco] a pair."

The Encyclopedia Britannica Online notes,"Men also wore French falls, a buff leather boot with a high top wide enough to be crushed down. After 1660 the jackboot . . . replaced the French falls." However, a knowledgeable staff member at Colonial Williamsburg has emailed me that French falls, while remaining a mystery, were definitely not a boot but were something more than a shoe, and that they were worn by both sexes.

Have you any information about the French fall that might help me, or can you refer me to a person or institution that may be able to assist? 

This comes with my thanks in advance for your advice.

<H3><A name="Northern Neck">Robert Carter and the Northern Neck Proprietary</A> 
</H3>

<P>On September 18, 1649, British King Charles II gave a patent for a large section of Virginia between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, extending west to the heads of these rivers, to seven of the loyal followers who were in exile with him. The lands conveyed in this patent,known as the Northern Neck Proprietary, were to involve Robert Carter heavily during two periods of his life, and the second of those periods was to provide him with an opportunity to build the fortunes of his family in a way unprecedented in Virginia. </P>

<P>There were problems with the Proprietary from the beginning. These included the actual scope of the patent since Virginians and those in England defined the heads of rivers by different standards. Collecting rents from settlers in the Proprietary was very difficult as was the enforcement of other rights exercised in such royally-granted areas. By the turn of the  eighteenth century, control of the Proprietary had come to one man, the fifth Lord Thomas Fairfax who also inherited a new patent issued by King James II in 1688 which established the western limits of the Proprietary as the "first heads or springs" of the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, meshing it nicely with southern border of the Maryland Proprietary to the north. While some of the original proprietors' rights had been lost, the collecting of quit rents from settlers had been established through the efforts of their agent in Virginia, William Fitzhugh, ,and through Lord Fairfax himself who persuaded "Richard Lee, a large and widely respected Northern Neck landholder, to make quit rent payments to the Proprietors." <CITE>Brown, p. 37.</CITE> This ensured that the proprietors received income from their property in Virginia, and made it extremely valuable to them.</P>

<P>Robert Carter lived in the Proprietary as Lancaster County lies in it. He had therefore been well aware of it from his youth. He had, as a member of the House of Burgesses, led a fight against the Proprietary in the session of 1695 that had been brought on by the Proprietor's agents, George Brent and William Fitshugh, attempts to establish the proprietors rights to escheats, quit rents, and other matters. "Carter made a savage attack on the agents. Under six heads he listed the 'abuses' practiced" and seems to have overstated the case "by what were acknowledged to be in the main unfair accusations." <CITE>Davis, Fitzhugh, p. 43.</CITE></P>

<P>William Fitzhugh died in October 1701 and George Brent had died several years earlier. When Lord Fairfax approached the great London merchant, widely acknowledged to be extremely knowledgeable about Virginia for which he had been agent, for advice about a new agent in the colony, Perry recommened Robert Carter, and he was accepted. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>He showed diligence in its interests--and to his own profit. He quickly increased the number of those who followed the example of Richard Lee in settling for past-due quit rents. Deputies promptly collected current accounts. More and more grants were issued in the western, unoccupied parts of the Northern Neck. Carter did not deny himself what he granted others. Soon after he became agent, he had two friends patent about 13,500 acres, which were transferred to him. In 1709 he "took up" 912 acres of choice land on the Occoquan in the name of a three-year-old son. <CITE>Freeman, Washington, p. 489.</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE>

After Lord Fairfax died in January 1710, his son inherited his title and his five-sixths shares in the Northern Neck. In May, his grandmother died leaving the new Lord Fairfax her one-sixth share. However, because he was only sixteen years old, the affairs of the Proprietary fell into the hands of his mother. She had advisors who counseled her that the return from the Virginia lands was too low and that she should appoint a new agent. She selected Edmund Jenings who signed a lease for a period of years paying about &pound;425 per year.

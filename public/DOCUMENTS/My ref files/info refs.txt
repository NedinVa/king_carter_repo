Next, make your jpg declarations. To do this, go to the line:

      <!ENTITY filename SYSTEM "filename.jpg" NDATA jpg>

This line is a template for your declarations. Use the CTRL k and CTRL y commands to cut and paste this line each time for as many images as you have.

So, for the text Mother by Kathleen Norris, NorMoth, the beginning of the file is changed to:

      <!DOCTYPE TEI.2 SYSTEM 'teixlite.dtd' [
      <!NOTATION jpg SYSTEM "JPEG">
      <!ENTITY NorMocov SYSTEM "NorMocov.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMospi SYSTEM "NorMospi.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMotit SYSTEM "NorMotit.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMo001 SYSTEM "NorMo001.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMo029 SYSTEM "NorMo029.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMo054 SYSTEM "NorMo054.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMo083 SYSTEM "NorMo083.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMo095 SYSTEM "NorMo095.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMo108 SYSTEM "NorMo108.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY NorMo137 SYSTEM "NorMo137.jpg" NDATA jpg>
      <!ENTITY % ISOlat1 SYSTEM "ISOlat1.pen"> %ISOlat1;
      <!ENTITY % ISOlat2 SYSTEM "ISOlat2.pen"> %ISOlat1;
      <!ENTITY % ISOnum SYSTEM "ISOnum.pen"> %ISOlat1;
      <!ENTITY % ISOpub SYSTEM "ISOpub.pen"> %ISOlat1;
      <!ENTITY % ISOtech SYSTEM "ISOtech.pen"> %ISOlat1;
      ]>
      <TEI.2 id="NorMoth"> 




<!ENTITY abdn.ac.uk/virtualmuseum/index.php?page=object_detail&prefix=ABDUA&num=18746&firstview=true&mt=&sign=&viewnumber=&resultsperpage=9 SYSTEM 
“http://www.abdn.ac.uk/virtualmuseum/index.php?page=object_detail&prefix=ABDUA&num=18746&firstview=true&mt=&sign=&viewnumber=&resultsperpage=9” NDATA HTML>


In either case, the DTD must also include a declaration for the external entity TEIP3, which a processor can use to determine the intended URL, such as the following: 
<!ENTITY TEIP3 SYSTEM "http://www.tei-c.org/TEI/Guidelines/" NDATA HTML>


"http://etext.virginia.edu/users/brock/ColCurr.html" NDATA html>



The requirement to predefine all target URLs as external entities has some obvious advantages, from the point of view of simplifying the maintenance of a suite of reliable links. It may be easier to maintain a single document containing declarations for all external links than to search through a large suite of documents checking that each link is still valid. However, it may also be regarded as an unnecessary additional chore. As with other parts of the TEI scheme, this method also assumes that external entity declarations can easily be declared and embedded in a DTD subset, a mechanism which may not be appropriate in all XML processing environment. 
For these reasons, TEI encoders may wish to declare an additional attribute url for the elements xptr and xref . Since in XML it is permissable to add attributes to an existing element by means of an additional ATTLIST declaration, all that is needed is to provide a DOCTYPE declaration like the following: 
<!DOCTYPE TEI.2 PUBLIC "-//TEI P4//DTD Main Document 
Type//EN" "tei2.dtd" [
<!ENTITY % TEI.XML        "INCLUDE">
<!ENTITY % TEI.prose "INCLUDE">
<!ENTITY % TEI.linking "INCLUDE">
<!ATTLIST xref url CDATA #IMPLIED >
<!ATTLIST xptr url CDATA #IMPLIED >

]>


A document with these additional declarations can then simply specify the intended target of a cross-reference using the new url attribute without further formality: 
<p>This is discussed in
<xref url="http://www.tei-c.org/TEI/Guidelines/SA.html">the 
chapter on linking</xref>.

or, equivalently, 
<p>This is discussed in
<xptr url="http://www.tei-c.org/TEI/Guidelines/SA.html"/>.




Hello,
REF
To tag a reference internal to a document (such as footnote #23), the target is tagged as:

<ref target="n23">23</ref>

And the text of note #23 is tagged as:

<ref id="n23">This is the text of the footnote.</ref>



XREF
To tag an external reference (such as a link to another web page), use xref with a doc attribute containing a unique ID:

<xref doc="ColCurr">text that will be linked</xref>

and in the header to the XML file, declare that xref doc as you would any other external entity (such as an image):

<!NOTATION html SYSTEM "HTML">
<!ENTITY ColCurr SYSTEM "http://etext.virginia.edu/users/brock/ColCurr.html" NDATA html>
(These lines go at the top of the document -- underneath the other entity declarations like ISOlat1, ISOlat2, etc.)

(That second line pattern is:)
<!ENTITY uniqueID SYSTEM "http://weblink" NDATA html>

I hope this is clear, but feel free to contact me with questions!

Best,
Cindy

This from our friend Rick Altman of CorelWorld and PPTLive fame:

"... there is nothing anywhere across the site that would look like an email address to the address-harvesting robots when 
they come looking for spam fuel. All email addresses are cloaked within a simple JavaScript routine."


A few hundred of you wanted to see that code, so here it is...


<script language="JavaScript">
< !--
emailname = "[name]"
emailserver = "[domain.com]"
document.write("<a href='mailto:" +
emailname + "@" + emailserver +"'>");
document.write(emailname + "@" + emailserver);
document.write("</a>");
//-->
< /script>


Place this snippet of code directly into your HTML copy, at the point where you want the email link. If your email 
address is snoopy@doghouse.com, then you would replace [name] with snoopy and [domain.com] with doghouse.com. 
The next line of code takes the two variables and creates the proper email link, by combining them with the " mailto" 
statement and the "@" sign. The next line is where you decide what the link should say. If you want it to display 
"Send me email -- woof!" you would just place that in quotes between the parenthesis. The way it is scripted above, the
 link will merely display the email address itself. No matter what you set for the display, the email address will never 
show itself to spam harvesters.

2. Hide Email Addresses With JavaScript

The special HTML character alone may not do the trick though. Before
long, email spiders may be configured to look for it and replace it
with the @ symbol. Then you're back with a full inbox of unwanted mail.

So consider using JavaScript to parse the email address components.
Be sure to change the variable names to reflect your site and email
address! Also, remember to keep the document.write statement on one
line in your HTML code to avoid getting a JavaScript error message on
your Web page.

Place the script in the BODY section of your document. 

<p>Send your comments and questions to our 

<script language=javascript>

  <!--

  var contact = "Newsletter Editor"

  var email = "news"

  var emailHost = "netmechanic.com"

  document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email + "@" +
emailHost+ ">" + contact + "</a>" + ".")

  //-->

</script>

</p>

Hide Email Address by Using JavaScript

 Instead of statically inserting the email address on the page you
use client side java script to display the address correctly in the
browser. A sample script is shown below all you need to do is to
change the variable names recipient, host and email for your site. 

<p>Your feedback is important to us-thank you <p>

<script language=javascript>

  <!--

  var recipient = "steve"

  var email = "feedback"

  var Host = "oeupdates.com"

  document.write("<a href=" + "mail" + "to:" + email + "@" + Host+
">" + recipient + "</a>" + ".")

Hide Email Address by Using JavaScript and Encryption

This is the method I prefer and use. There are number of free tools
that generate an encoded email address that appears as meaningless
text to an email extractor but displays correctly in the browser and
works correctly when clicked.

 The tools usually have a web interface where you enter your details
in a simple form and the code is generate automatically for you. You
then copy and paste the encoded text on to your web page. The one I
use is at-

http://hivelogic.com/enkoder/form

The above tool works only for HTML web pages if you want to encode
your email address when posting at newsgroup forums or for use in
plain text email then you can use the Advanced Email Link Generator
with Anti-Spam Encoder. However you should note that this tool does
not use encryption!
Hide Email Address by Using a Web Form

Instead of using the mailto tag to send mail you use the form tag
instead. The user has to submit the form and a script processes the
form and can then forward then the form to you via email ( see
website forms or creating a contact page).

This is by far the most secure and easiest to implement but requires
that your hosting provider supports scripting like PHP. If it doesn't
there are many third party form providers but they usually display
advertising on the form.



1. Use Special HTML Characters

This is the easiest way to thwart the email spiders, but it's also
the easiest method for the spiders to detect and compensate for:
simply use the "&#64;" character in place of the @ sign in your email
addresses.

Put it in your code inside a link or just as a text email address:

Link: <a href="mailto:news&#64;netmechanic.com">Email Us!</a>

Text email: Email us at: news&#64;netmechanic.com

Since the HTML code doesn't look like a proper email address, the
email spider doesn't harvest it. But the browser understands the code
and displays it on the page properly. Visitors will be able to send
you mail from the linked address if they have their mail client
configured to do so. Otherwise, they can cut and paste from your Web
page into their mail client to email you.

CSS unicode-bidi http://www.csarven.ca/hiding-email-addresses#cssunicodebidi
span.codedirection { unicode-bidi:bidi-override; direction: rtl; }

<p><span class="codedirection">zab.rab@oof</span></p>

/* Output on screen: */
email me: foo@bar.baz
The key in this method is to change the direction of text from left-to-right (default) to right-to-left. This method is one of my favourites, since this CSS unicode-bidi algorithm is supported by more browsers. This method will display the email backwards for those user-agents without the CSS features, which could be bothersome to invert.

CSS display be none http://www.csarven.ca/hiding-email-addresses#cssdisplay
p span.hide { display:none; }

<p>foo@bar<span class="hide">null</span>.baz</p>

/* Output on screen: */
foo@bar.baz
Yet, there is a third method to hide emails using CSS. In this case, we just remove some null text from the body of the email with display none. This property is largely supported.

If the bot script does not parse through the CSS, then the techniques above can be handy to hide email, otherwise the email may face the possibility of getting spam. Although, not overly difficult to build these scripts, they take longer time to process the stylsheet data, which may or not be a worthwhile exercise.

Again, same accessibility issues as the previous CSS technique apply here. Also the good thing with these CSS tricks is that, they are visible on screen, and can be selected and copied to the clipboard. The email is textually available to the user, however they can't click on the link in order to open their email client

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The editor has been unable to determine what Carter meant by the use of the phrase "piece of Dowles."  There is nothing in the <title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title> that is useful unless one stretches the word "Dowles" to mean "dowels."  Unfortunately any further correcpondence about "Dowles" is not extant.</note>

 <note id="n2"> [2] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3]  Thomas Woodward commanded the <hi rend="italics">Providence,</hi> a ship owned by Captain John Hyde &amp; Company, during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1729. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194 and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia,</bibl></cit> and Carter's letter to the firm,  <xref to="/users/berkeley/public/C23i17a.xml">September 17, 1723.</xref>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Parliament had passed the act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. The colony appointed John Randolph as its agent. Randolph would not leave for England until 1729; his mission would be successful.<corr resp="editor"></corr> (<cit><bibl>Arthur Pierce Middleton. <title>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</title> [Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.] p. 116.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] King George II (1683-1760) reigned from 1727 until 1760. ("The Royal English Monarchy." <cit><bibl>http://scotlandroyalty.org/kings.html.</bibl></cit> 11/20/03)</note>

 <note id="n6">[6]  This firm had been established in Madeira by Joseph Hayward in 1715. It became Hayward &amp; Rider (1721-1723),  Hayward Miles &amp; Rider (1725-1730), and other partnerships later.

Bowen, Margarette Lincoln, Nigel Rigby, <hi rend="italics">eds. </hi><title>The Worlds of the East India Company.</title> [Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2002]. p. 156) </note>

<note id="n7">[7]  A pipe is "a large container of definite capacity for storing solids or liquids, such as meat, fish, or oil. Now: spec. a large cask for storing wine or cider." Wikipedia, citing a book by Ronald E. Zupco, states that a pipe was half a tun which was "a large vat or vessel, most often holding 252 wine gallons," meaning a pipe was roughly 126 gallons of wine.

Zupko. <title>A Dictionary of Weights and Measures for the British Isles: The Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century</title>.<title> [Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society</title>, 1985, 168.]</bibl></cit>) </note> 


<note id="n8">[8] The 140 ton <hi rend="italics">Welcome</hi> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27e17a.html">May 17, 1727</xref>.

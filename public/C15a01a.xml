<salute>Worthy Sr.&mdash;&mdash;</salute>              
 
</opener> 
                       
<p>In obedience to Yor. Commands, Requiring me to give an <lb/>Accot. of What Quantity  of Land I 
think may be unpatented <lb/>in the Bodys of <name type="county">Stafford</name> and <name type="county">Richmond</name> Countys;  And what <lb/>may be 
Surplus; And how far above the Seatments in<lb/> those Countys the  Land is Patented.</p> 
 
<p>To all which after the Acknowledging my incapacity for the performance <lb/>of so Difficult a Task I 
shall with due Submition Humbly offer my Rude <lb/>Conceptions as followeth&mdash;</p> 
 
<p>First as to what Lands may be unpatented in the Bodys of those Countys. <lb/>I must Confess myself 
to be too much <unclear>[ . . . ]</unclear> to Seek in the knowledge of what Lands&mdash; <lb/>are already 
patented in those parts to give any Accot: wth. Certainty of what Lands <lb/>may yet be unpatented by 
reason there is Sevll: large Tracts of Land  particularly in <lb/>Stafford County which by Comon Report 
are under patents that as to Bounds Scitu=<lb/>=ation or place are altogether unknown to any persons in 
these parts the Patentees <lb/>and imediate owners living out of this Colony and no certain  Accot. to be 
given of &mdash;<lb/>them: I have Endeavrd. as far as possible to get what  information I could in <lb/>this 
particular both by Enquiry and other means but  cannot find any Certainty&mdash; <lb/>in all my proceedings 
worthy to be laid before yor: View, I have Endeavrd: accord=<lb/>=ing to my notions of the Scituation of 
the Back or unihabitted parts of both <lb/>Countys to draw a <sic corr="scheme">Scheem</sic> for yor: View, but upon my best 
performance I must <lb/>acknowledge it to be so imperfect and uncertain, that I can in no way think 
<lb/>it worth relying on: It is a Vast Tract of Land Contained wthin the limmits <lb/>of those Bounds and 
so Desart &amp; Wild in a great many parts, that I must think <lb/>no one person so well acquainted therewith 
as to give any Certain Accot: worthy to <lb/>be depended on, in relation to the matter  now before me; 
besides there is nothing, <lb/>renders this design more uncertain and Dark then the Charter or Grant 
Patent <lb/>Called the <note target="n2">Brent Town Land<hi rend="sup">2</hi></note> which is Variously Spoaken of by all 
persons And if <lb/>Mr. Brents notions (and those in that Interest) are allowable, that Patent will 
<lb/>include all the Lands within Six Miles both of Rappa<add resp="editor">[hannock]</add> and 
<name type="river" reg="Potomac">Patowmack</name> Rivers <lb/>from the very Mountains down to the Old patents on <name type="river" reg="Rappahannock">Rappa</name> and Patowmack 
<lb/>as low as the Falls of Rappa: and <name type="stream">Acquia</name> on Patowmack and consequently leave <lb/>but a small 
string of Land on Rappa: which as much of it, as is of any Vallue <lb/>is already taken up to within  15 or 
16, Miles of the Montains and all on &mdash;<lb/>Patowmack may be reckoned under old Patents almost to the 
Falls thereof. &mdash;<lb/>this with Submition is as much as  my weak Capacity can offer on this Head.</p> 
 
<p>I shall therefore proceed to the Second,</p> 
 
<p>Which is what Surplus Land may be Contain'd in those Lands already Granted <lb/>with in those Limmitts.&mdash;</p> 
 
<p>And here I must likewise Confess my Self as much to Seek to offer anything&mdash; <lb/>Satisfactory as in 
the foregoing particular Only this I may presume to Say  
 
<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/> 
from what knowledge I have amongst the old Patents in Stafford County that 
the <add resp="editor">[re]</add> <lb/>is no Part of the <name type="place">Northern Neck</name> where there may be presum'd to be 
more <add resp="editor">[s]</add>u<add resp="editor">[r]</add>pl<add resp="editor">[u]</add>s <lb/>Land then in 
that County most persons that hold old Patents dread the Execution <lb/>of the Law concerning 
prosessioning of Land and I believe I may safely say there <lb/>is no County in Virga but what has put 
forward for the Execution of that Law <lb/>Except Stafford County where it has laid Dormant to this 
time. As for the &mdash;<lb/>Lands in the upper parts of Richmond and Stafford Countys whole patents are&mdash; 
<lb/>of late Date  I have less reason to think there may be Surplus Lands in them <lb/>because more Care 
has been taken in Surveys of Late then in former times. <lb/>Which is what I shall presume at this 
time to Offer on this Head.</p> 
 
<p>And as to the last part Which is how far the Lands patented abov<add resp="editor">[e]</add> <lb/>the 
Seatments in both Countys I shall presume to Offer as followeth</p> 
 
<p>In Richmond County the Land may be said to be all patented and Seated in <lb/>Sevll places as farr 
above the Falls of Rappa: as the Deep Run which <lb/>goes out of Rappa: about 12 Miles above the Falls 
thereof and heads with <lb/>the South Run of Acquia Creek going out of Patowmack River about four 
<lb/>Miles above Patowmack Creek an inconsiderable parcell of &mdash;<lb/>Barren Land which lyes in small 
parcells, And here I presume it may <lb/>be about 18 or 20 Miles a cross the Neck from the Mouth of the 
Deep &mdash;<lb/>Run  to some part of Patowmack River between <name type="stream">Chappawamsick</name> and <lb/>Acquia Creeks, 
from the Deep Run where there is now two or three &mdash;<lb/>Settlements going forward, up Rappa River 
there is not above 3500 Acres <lb/>of Land now patented till one Comes to the Great Marsh Run which is 
<lb/>computed to fall into Rappa River about thirty  miles above the Falls&mdash; <lb/>thereof and here on Rappa: 
River Colo <note n="PL">Phillip Ludwell</note> holds about <lb/>6000 Acres, 2000 Whereof lyes 
on the lower side of the Mouth of the &mdash;<lb/><name type="stream">Marsh Run</name>, and the rest on the upper side, which is the highest&mdash; 
<lb/>Land under patent on Rappa River or in Richmond County. The&mdash; <lb/>Marsh Run is Computed to 
Run into the Woods about three Miles and then&mdash; <lb/>begins the <name type="place">Great Marsh</name> which holds  near a Mile in 
length and in some&mdash; <lb/>places a quarter and More in breadth, about  a Mile above the great&mdash; <lb/>Marsh 
lyes two others of no great Extent on this Run and the Branches <lb/>going out of it, I compute about 
7000 Acres of Land to be already taken <lb/>up and four or five Settlements going forward, Here it is to 
be noted that <lb/>the Marsh Run heads against the head Branches of the Main South  West <lb/>Run of 
Occaquan River, And that from the Mouth of the Marsh Run&mdash; <lb/>to the  Mouth of Occaquan River the 
Neck may be computed to be very <lb/>near fourty Miles a Cross</p> 
 
<pb n="3"/><lb/><lb/> 
<p>O<add resp="editor">[n Peto]</add>wmack River in Stafford County the Land is all in Genll: Patented 
<lb/><unclear>[ . . . ]</unclear>de,  to within two Miles or thereabouts of the Falls thereof, Excluding the&mdash; 
<lb/>Land  for which <note target="n3">Majr: West<hi rend="sup">3</hi></note> and others have a Warrant for, above and at 
the Falls.&mdash;<lb/>And the upper plantation is computed to be about five miles below the Falls, there <lb/>was 
formerly a plantation Where <note target="n4">Majr: Ousley<hi rend="sup">4</hi></note> lived about three miles below&mdash; 
<lb/>the Falls which is now deserted and grown up to a Thickett, here I must not <lb/>omitt mentioning 
that <note n="DM">Capt. McCarty</note> of <name type="county">Westmoreland County</name> has a patent for <lb/>7000 
Acres of Land about 25 Miles above the Falls of Patowmack River&mdash; <lb/>comonly called the Sugr: Lands; 
As for the back Settlements in Stafford county, there <lb/>is none that I know of, above three Miles from 
Patowmack River above <name type="stream">Occaquan</name> <lb/>R<add resp="editor">[un but thr]</add>ee or four lately begun about 
<add resp="editor">[8 or]</add> 10 miles up t<add resp="editor">[he south?]</add> Branch of <lb/><name type="stream">Pohick Run</name>, 
and it holds Generally so as loe as Acquia Creek that there is <lb/>none above four or five Miles from 
Navagable Water, but what are upon the <lb/>Main Runs of Occaquan, where there are at least ten or 
twelve lately begun <lb/>but as I hinted before by Some persons Reputed to be within the Bounds of 
<lb/>the  Brent Town Charter&mdash;&mdash; thus</p> 
 
<p>Worthy Sr&mdash;</p> 
 
<p>I have presum'd to Committ my rude Notions to&mdash; <lb/>Paper, Always esteeming it my Duty to Exert 
my <lb/>best Abilitys for y<add resp="editor">[our serv]</add>ice when <unclear>[ . . . ]</unclear> please 
<lb/>to lay  Yor: comands upon me; Hoping that if I have <lb/>been wide of giving the Satisfaction you 
Expected&mdash;<lb/>it will be imputed to the Intricacy of the Subject <lb/>and not to my want of Zeal for Yor:

<note id="n1">[1] Thomas Hooper was appointed sheriff of Stafford County in 1719.  He  was involved with RC's affairs as later letters will show.</note> 
 
<note id="n2">[2] Brent Town was a speculative land development put together by Nicholas Hayward (d. <hi rend="italics">ante</hi> 1697) of London, a notary public, merchant, and speculator. Hayward assembled a syndicate composed of London merchants Robert Bristow (1643-1707)  and Richard Foote (his brother-in-law), and George Brent of "Woodstock," Stafford County. The syndicate purchased on January 10, 1686/87, 
from Lord Culpeper, by then the sole owner of the Northern Neck Proprietary, 30,006 acres in Stafford County "Between the Courses of the said Two Rivers, Rappahannock and Potowmack  . . . upon and Between the Southwest and Northeast Branches of Ocaquant Creek.  . . ." Hayward obtained a dispensation from King James II that would allow the Hugenots that he hoped to settle on the land to have "the full exercise  of their Religion." The town that Hayward hoped to build on the tract was called Brenton, "but this was corrupted by local [Virginia] usage into Brent Town, and that came to be the designation of the whole tract." Hayward was not successful in persuading Hugenots to move to the lands, and, after flirting with other possibilities, the tract remained unsettled and unsurveyed at the time of his death about 1697. The members of the syndicate and their heirs bequeathed and sold their rights in the 
Brenton tract for generations. RC was to have considerable trouble over the tract after becoming agent of the proprietors  again in 1721. He was pressed to grant lands in the area of Brenton, but it was very difficult to do so because the tract had not been surveyed&mdash;and was not to be until 1737-1738.  Fairfax Harrison, in a chapter entitled "Brent Town, Ravensworth and the Hugenots," in his <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William</title> (from which all quotations used here are taken) tells the story of Brent Town  extremely well.  (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title> pp. 177-198.</bibl></cit> See also <cit><bibl n="B5">Davis,  <title>William Fitzhugh. . . .</title> p. 191, fn 2</bibl></cit>, and other sources.)</note> 
 
<note id="n3">[3] This probably is John West (d. <hi rend="italics">ante</hi> 1748), third of that name in Virginia. Fairfax Harrison speculates that he may have lived on the north branch of Little Hunting Creek, "where the 'West's Grove' of later generations stood."

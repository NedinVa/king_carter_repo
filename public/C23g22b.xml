<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Landon Jones, July 22, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Landon Jones, son of his late sister-in-law, Mary (Landon) Jones Swan, July 22, 1723,  concerning his mother's death and the status of law suits against Carter as her executor brought by Thomas Edwards, clerk of the Lancaster County court.  Carter informs Jones, who lives in London, that his mother's son-in-law, John Swan, had made an agreement with her concerning improvements to the Swan estate but her papers were destroyed at her death. John Swan's widow has married Edwards who claims the majority of the estate. Carter plans to fight Edwards' suits aggressively, and if he wins, will see that Jones receives his portion of the estate.</p>

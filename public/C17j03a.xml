<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, 1717 October
3</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, October
3, 1717, an addition to an earlier letter (probably that of September
16, 1717) hoping that the victory achieved by the Tories at the last
session (of Parliament) will result in peace in the country and will
"promote the real good of the community" and "the securities of [the]
Protestant Religion." He comments that the colony understands that
the repeal of the tobacco law has been accomplished and that planters
are giving "orders to strip in the old way." He is glad to hear that
the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> has reached home safely and hopes
for her early return,
and concludes with a comment that the recent "gust" has not damaged
crops as badly as had been feared.</p>

<p>This, a short additional line <lb/>
by a <note target="n1">Brig, Colman</note>.  Our great news <lb/>
at this time is the triumph the <lb/>
Torys have gained in the last Session. <lb/>
May all these divisions end in the <lb/>
peace of the nation.  Its no great <lb/> 
matter to us who is uppermost, <lb/> 
so they promote the real good of the <lb/> 
community and the <sic corr="securty ">securtie</sic>  of <lb/> 
<note target="n2">the Protestant Religion</note>.</p>

<p>The <note target="n3">repeal of the Tobo. Law</note> is a <lb/> 
believed truth and grounded on<lb/> some of the merchants letters.
Mr. <lb/>
<note n="MP">Perry</note> writes he took it to be neer <lb/> 
effected: so <sic corr="we ">wee</sic> give orders to strip in <lb/> 
the old way.

The <note n="CS"><q><name type="ship">Carter's</name></q></note>
<sic corr="safety ">saftie</sic> is a piece of
<lb/> 
pleasing news. I hope you'll think <lb/> 
it proper to dispatch her back to us <lb/>
<note target="n4">with the first</note>. I came a few <sic
corr="days ">daies</sic> since
from the <lb/> falls of our River.  

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>The gust <sic corr="has ">hath </sic> done
little damage there.
<lb/>They have generally pretty good crops <lb/>in the upper parts of
the country and good in <lb/>quality too. There will not be that
scarcity <lb/>of Tobo. as was expected from our storm

<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-
Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,
Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently
there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now
lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As
they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n2">[2] As the Whigs were firmly in control of both
Parliament and the government at this time, it is not clear what RC
means.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Governor Alexander Spotswood had gotten through
the General Assembly in 1713 an act "for preventing frauds in Tobacco
payments And for the better Improveing the Staple of Tobacco." Among
other provisions (such as the establishment of tobacco inspections
houses and of inspectors of tobacco), this law prohibited the
stemming of tobacco. There was immediate opposition to
the law, but Dodson in his biography of Spotswood notes that the
lieutenant governor had the power of appointment of the tobacco
inspectors, and "twenty-seven burgesses, a clear  majority, were
tobacco agents" in 1714, which helped defeat amendments to the act
that were brought up at that session.  The colonial opposition
together with opposition from the English merchants led to the repeal
of the act in 1717; the news was announced in Virginia on November
12.  (<cit><bibl n="B21">Dodson. <title>Alexander Spotswood.</title>

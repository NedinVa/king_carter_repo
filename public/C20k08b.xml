<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, November 8,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, November
8, 1720, granson of Micajah and son of Richard, in response to one of
his. He reminds Perry that he has been a very good customer of
Perry's family's firm for many years and that "my purpose is rather
to Increase It than otherways." He gives some general instructions
about the handling of his tobacco sales, and comments negatively on
rumors in Virginia that British merchants are talking of "new ways to
oppress us. that is to make up pay freigt for all our goods &amp;
half perCt. for receiving our bills," which he hopes Perry will not
take up. He adds that he hopes a new ship will be found for Captain
Bagwell, and concludes by thanking Perry for sending his respects to
"my son in the place of Yor. father who was his first Friend."</p>

"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Peter Leheup, May 18, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Peter Leheup, the colony's agent in London, May 18, 1727, to inform him of the actions Carter has taken as acting governor, especially of reports and payments made. He notes particularly the concern in the colony that war with Spain may have begun, and that the warship stationed in the colony is convoying ships well off the coast.</p>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Carter, February 23,
1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his son, John Carter, February 23, 1721,
in London concerning his anger at merchant William Dawkins there who
has written Carter very arrogantly about his handling of John's
younger brothers, Charles, Robert, and Landon. The younger boys are
also in England for their education, and their father directs John to
relieve Dawkins of their care, and to turn it over to merchant Thomas
Evans. </p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] This Arthur Lee may be a son of Francis Lee (1648-
1724), third son of Richard Lee the emigrant; Francis had returned to
England to become a merchant in London.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n2">[2] Charles Carter (1707-1764), Robert Carter's tenth
child with his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis Carter. He
would live at "Cleve," King George County, and inherit a number of
proporties in that area from his father.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n3">[3] Robert Carter (1704-1732) was Carter's seventh child
by his second wife, Elizabeth Landon (Willis) Carter. Robert was sent
to England to school in 1718; see <xref to="C18g09a">Carter's 
letter to William Dawkins,</xref> July 9, 1718. Robert married
Priscilla
Churchill and had two children, one of whom, Robert Carter III, would
be known as "Councillor" Carter of "Nomini Hall." Robert  would die a
few months before his father.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n4">[4] Landon Carter (1710-1778) was Carter's seventh
child by his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis, and was the
second child to bear the name Landon, the first having died shortly
after his birth in 1708. Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond
County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom
own "Sabine Hall" today.</note><lb/>

<note id="n7">[7] A ferry across the Rappahannock from Lancaster County was located at this Middlesex County property, probably owned by Thomas Machen who appears in the records of Christ Church Parish, Middlesex, in 1725. It was a short distance from Machens across the county to another ferry located at Seatons in Gloucester County on the south bank of the Piankatank River. Carter regularly took this route to Williamsburg.

<note id="n8">[8] "Buckles," or "Corotoman," was a property very close to Carter 's home, also called "Corotoman." But this property was under the direction of an overseer named John Buckles, and Carter  frequently refers to it as "Buckles."</note><lb/>

<note id="n10">[10]  Carter Burwell (1716-1756) was Robert Carter's grandson by his daughter Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721). Carter Burwell would live at "Carter's Grove," and would marry Lucy Grymes in 1738.

<note id="n10.21">[10.21] Little evidence of Elizabeth Page's apparently short life can be found today. Carter noted on June 13, 1722, that he had paid (while away from home) "To my daughter Page Nurse 1: 1: 9." This was very likely a "wet nurse" for the newborn granddaughter. </note><lb/>

<note id="n10.3">[10.3] Alexander Spotswood (1646-1740) had been the lieutenant governor from 1710 and would be succeeded in September 1722 by Hugh S\Drysdale. He would remain in the colony after his term.</note><lb/> 

<note id="n10.4">[10.4] This was Charles Stagg (d. c. 1735), the manager of the first theatre in Williamsburg, and a dancing master. He and his wife Mary had come to Virginia about 1715 and were indentured to merchant William Levingston to teach dancing. Levingston entered a contract with them the next year that they would attempt to obtain a license for  "the sole provilege of Acting Comedies, Drolls or other kind of Stage Plays within any part of the sd colony not only for the three years next ensueing the date hereof but for as much longer time."

<note id="n10.5">[10.5] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</note><lb/>

<note id="n11">[11] There was a ferry over the Piankatank River near Berkeley Island operated by Bailey Seaton that Carter often refers to when describing trips to Williamsburg. The Seaton property is noted on the Fry-Jefferson map as on the Piankatank in Gloucester County.</note><lb/>

<note id="n13">[13] William Russell (1680?-1741) was a well-known ranger and explorer who eventually settled in Prince William County (later Fauquier). Fairfax Harrison thinks he may have been one of the rangers who accompanied Spotswood's Knights of the Golden Horseshoe.

<note id="n15">[15] Henry Hager (c. 1644-1738) was a "pastor of their own Evangelical Reformed Faith" who came to Virginia with the Siegenian German miners in the spring of 1714, and moved with them to Germanna, and later to Germantown.

<note id="n16">[16] Governor Alexander Spotswood had encouraged immigration of Germans into Virginia in 1714, and they settled "in what was then Stafford Co. . . .. later Prince William and now Fauquier."  The men worked in Spotswood's iron mines, but around 1718 took grants in the proprietary in what was then Stafford County. (See

<note id="n16.5">[16.5] John Wormeley (1689-1727), a younger son of Ralph Wormeley (d. 1701) for whom Carter had been a trustee in John's youth. When his older brother, Ralph, died in 1714, John inherited all of their father's considerable estate in Middlesex and York counties.  He married Elizabeth Tayloe and had six children.

<note id="n17.5">[17.5]   John Zuil was a merchant and was probably the ship's captain that Carter mentioned in his diary 1722 August 1, "Zuil Saild Gave me a Bottle Snuff."  Carter recorded a diary note about him the following year as well: 1723 December 30 "mr Zuil &amp; man came back" [from church]. In what British city Zuil lived is not clear, but it may have been Liverpool because city directories of 1767-1773 list a John Zuil as a merchant, first in
Cable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period.

<note id="n24.5">[24.5] This mill, sometimes referred to by Carter as the small or little mill, was located in Lancaster County and may have been the one "on the head of the Eastern branch of Corotoman" purchased by Carter's brother from Thomas and Elizabeth Haynes January 4, 1670.

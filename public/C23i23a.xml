<title>Letter from William Cage to Micajah Perry, September 23, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>William Cage, the trustee of Lady Fairfax's estate, writes to London merchant, Micajah Perry, September 23, 1723, concerning the affairs of the proprietary estate in Virginia, commenting specifically on a "packet" he has received from the estate's agent, Robert Carter. He informs Perry that Lord Fairfax will be willing to press the proprietor's interest before the Board of Trade as Carter wishes, and that he assumes that the opinions of the Attorney and Solicitor General must be obtained again, as Carter already has. He sends all the papers relative to the case that he has received from Carter, and asks Perry to let him or Lord Fairfax know when Fairfax should appear before the Board. In March, he will be in London, and will then need the rent money as Lord Fairfax's 3rd sister will come of age and he must pay what is due to her from the estate. In a post script, he states that he cannot comment on Carter's statement about Edmund Jenings's accounts for rent for the proprietary until he has seen Mr. Adamson, but the Jenings account is new and strange to him.</p>

</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant and Alderman [Micajah] Perry, April 16, 1730, reporting the safety of Perry's ships, requesting accounts of the sales of his tobacco, noting the tobacco he will be shipping to Perry and the likely small crop in Virginia and Maryland, complaining strongly about the old newspapers the bookseller has sent, and requesting again that Perry find a tailor for the Burwell estates.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Carter held a lease to the Lloyd estate,which was that of John Lloyd, husband of his niece Elizabeth, for many years. He noted in a <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C23g13a.html">letter to Micajah Perry</xref> July 13, 1723, that the estate consisted of about 1,900 acres. These holdings apparently lay up the Rappahannock near the falls as Carter always  sent his sloop for its tobacco.  The estate's tobacco mark was the double arrowhead or double "L" which Carter frequently uses in his
diary and letters to refer to it. He undertook to buy the Lloyd estate in the later years of his life, and finally acquired it about 1732. </note>

In the 60s and 70s AD a town grew up on the site of Bath . . .In the late 17th century Bath continued to be a quiet market town. It largely depended on its springs. From 1661 Bath water was bottled and sold. . . . In the 18th century Bath became a much more genteel and fashionable place. It boomed in size. This was largely due to the efforts of Richard 'Beau' Nash 1674-1762 who was made Master of Ceremonies. Many fine buildings were erected in Bath. . . . A Pump Room was built in 1706. . . . During the Summer Georgian Bath was full of rich visitors. They played cards, went to balls and horse racing, went walking and horse riding. However the high life was only for a small minority."

<note id="n11"> [11] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry, April 16, 1730</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant and Alderman [Micajah] Perry, April 16, 1730, reporting the safety of Perry's ships, requesting accounts of the sales of his tobacco, noting the tobacco he will be shipping to Perry and the likely small crop in Virginia and Maryland, complaining strongly about the old newspapers the bookseller has sent, and requesting again that Perry find a tailor for the Burwell estates.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] This plantation apparently lay up the Rappahannock near the falls as Carter always sent his sloop for its tobacco. Carter was involved with the Lloyd estate, which was that of John Lloyd, husband of his niece Elizabeth. The estate's tobacco mark was the double arrowhead or double "L" which Carter frequently uses in his diary and letters to refer to it. He undertook to buy the Lloyd estate in the later years of his life, and finally acquired it about 1730.</note>

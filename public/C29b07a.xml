<note id="n1">[1] William Hall may have been a resident of Stafford County because that is where John Mercer lived at the time. See Carter's <xref doc="C29b07b">letter to Mercer</xref> this same day.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Warner was the surveyor of King George County in 1727; he laid off the town of Falmouth in 1728. Later he worked for Lord Fairfax, and prepared an important map of his holdings. (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison,  <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William</title>, 626-628.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Pohick Creek is located in today's Fairfax County and runs northwest to southeast passing just south of the town of Lorton and emptying into Gunston Cove off the Potomac River.  In Carter's time, this area was part of Stafford County.

<note id="n4">[4] John Mercer (1704-1768) emigrated from Ireland where he had been trained as an attorney. "He settled at Marlboroughtown [in then Stafford County] in 1726 as a practicing attorney and at once allowed a facile pen to get him into trouble with the government." He eventually lost his license to practice law, and turned to the land speculation that he had begun as soon as he reached Virginia. "He married first on June 10, 1725 Catherine Mason (June 21, 1707-June 15, 1750) only child of Colonel George Mason (16??-1716) and his second wife Elizabeth Waugh, daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Waugh."(<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William</title> p. 315;</bibl></cit>  <cit><bibl n="B24">Copeland and MacMaster. <title>The Five George Masons.</title></bibl></cit>; and "John Mercer."  http://www.rootsweb.com/~vastaffo/johnmercer.htm  11/4/03)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] A caveat is a  "formal notice filed with a court or officer to suspend a proceeding until filer is given a hearing . . .  a warning against certain acts." (<cit><bibl>"Meaning of CAVEAT." hyperdictionary. http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary.</bibl></cit>)</note>

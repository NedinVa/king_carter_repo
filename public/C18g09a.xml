<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, 1718 July 9</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 9, 1718, that the colony has received reports from several sources that Gibralter was under seige by the Spanish. The colonists are very concerned that ships that were on route to England, not knowing of the war, will be captured. He is especially concerned because two of his sons were sailing to England to school. He continues that a Liverpool ship, the <hi rend="italics">Caesar,</hi> has on board a hogshead of tobaacco shipped by "Mr. Lee" on Dawkins' account consigned to [merchant John] Pemberton who has been informed that he must account to Dawkins for it.</p>

<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now lost&mdash;from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections" obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and state have been added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>


<note id="n1">[1] The reports of a siege of Gibraltar were wrong.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter's sons Robert (1704-1732) and Charles (1706-1764) were on board the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> on their way to England for their further education. As the letter of July 26, 1718, from
Dawkins to Carter shows, they had arrived safely.</note>

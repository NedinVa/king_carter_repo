<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, July 16, 1730</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, bthe proprietor of the Northern Neck, July 16, 1730, to apprise him of the challenges to the proprietary being mounted in the colony, and to send him (not present) a copy of the recent statement of complaints against the proprietary prepared by the colony's House of Burgesses. Carter notes his shock at learning that the former lieutenant governor, Alexander Spotswood, has been making statements that Carter has no authority to make grants of land in the  proprietary which authority he notes he has always had from the several proprietors for whom he  has been agent or lessee. Carter reports that the leader of the opposition is John Grymes, the colony's receiver general, and that Grymes and his supporters are well financed.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] This letter is not presently extant.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] A caveat is a "process in court (originally in ecclesiastical courts) to suspend proceedings; a notice given by some party to the proper officer not to take a certain step until the party giving the notice has been heard in opposition."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Pres, </bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:223. </bibl></cit>) </note>

<note id="n3">[3] ". . . in which it is set forth among other matters of complaint 'that the head springs of the Rappahannock and Potomac are not yet known to any of your majesty's subjects;' that much inconvenience had resulted to grantees therefrom and praying the adoption of such measures as might lead to its ascertainment to the satisfaction of all parties interested. Lord Fairfax who by his marriage with the only daughter of Lord Culpeper had now succeeded to the proprietaryship of the N orthern Neck likewise feeling it due to <hi rend="italics">his</hi> grantees to have the question relieved from all further difliculty,  preferred his petition to the king in 1733 praying that his majesty would be pleased to order a commission to issue, for running out, marking, and ascertaining the bounds of His patent according to the true intent and meaning of his charter".  Robert Carter, who died in August 1732, would not know of the establisment of the royal commission to set the boundaries of the Northern Neck. (Samuel Kercheval. <title>A History of the Valley of Virginia.</title>[Winchester, Virginia:  Samuel H. Davis, 1833.]) </note>

<note id="n4">[4] "The receiver-generalship was a royal appointment" and the official was required to give bond both to the lord of the treasury and to the governor. "Those who filled the office of receiver-general were practially all councillors. . . . The duties of the receiver-general included the receiving of the quit-rents, the revenue arising from the export duty of two shillings per hogshead on tobacco, the one penny per pound on tobacco exported from Virginia . . .  the port duty, which was the revenue arising from the fifteen pence per ton on all vessels arriving in the colony, and all funds of the colony not received by the treasurer. . . .  He paid out of the revenue . . .  the salaries of the officers of the colony, also those of the auditor-general of the colonies and the solicitor of Virginia affairs, both of whom lived in England. All the public expenses of the colony, except, of course, those paid out of the funds held by the treasurer, were paid out of the funds received in his office. . . .  He of course reported to the lords of the treasury all payments made on the order of the governor. The accounts of the revenues and the reports of disbursements forwarded to the lords of the treasury were certified to by the auditor and the governor, and sent by the governor."  <cit><bibl>(Percy Scott Flippin. <title>The Financial Administration of the Colony of Virginia</title> [Johns Hopkins Press, 1915.] 41-42.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Alexander Spotswood (1646-1740), army officer with a succesful career, was a protege of George Hamilton, first earl of Orkney,  the royal governor of Virginia, who sent Spotswood to Virginia in 1710 as lieutenant governor. His first five years in the colony were fairly successful ones, but  his policies concerning land quit rents and over the colonial church brought confrontation with powerful members of the Council. Their interests in England led to Spotswood's dismissal as governor in 1722. He had acquired large land holdings, and he went to England in 1724 where he married and worked on securing the titles to his Virginia land holdings. In 1730 he returned to Virginia and remained there.  (Gwenda Morgan. <xref to="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26164">"Alexander Spotswood,"</xref> in the <title>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,</title> and Leonidas Dodson. <title>Alexander Spotswood, Governor of Colonial Virginia, 1710-22</title> [Philadelphia, 1932].)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Propietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.</note>

<note id="n7">[7] There is no explicit discussion of the Council of the resolution of the House of Burgesses to appropriate the money, but on June 17, 1730, the Council did approve the petitions of the persons from other colonies that Carter notes at the beginning of this letter. There is a brief discussion of the controversy over the western boundaries of the proprietary in Charter VIII of Stuart E.

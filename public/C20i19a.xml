<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, September 19, 1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, September 19, 1720, expressing hope that the Carter has arrived safely, and suggesting that Dawkins send her back to the colony as soon as possible because there is a very good crop this year, "the quality of It surpasses wt. has bin this many Years." He complains that he has not had a letter from Dawkins since April and hopes that the shoes he has ordered will arrive "before the frost Setts in hard upon us." Dawkins' report of his sales of 66 hogsheads of Carter's tobacco has arrived, and Carter notes that it probably was the last batch Dawkins will be able to sell at such prices. He resolves to send Dawkins "none but nice goods," and requests that Dawkins give his blessings to his sons Robert and Charles, then studying in England. He concludes by reporting that Dick Lee has been very ill but is recovering.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

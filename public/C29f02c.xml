<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Major [John] Holloway, June 2, 1729</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his attorney and friend, [John] Holloway, June 2, 1729, concerning the granting of lands on the Little Fork in areas that he believes belong to the proprietary. He speculates on the reasons behind the opposition to the proprietor's grant being made by the receiver general, John Grymes, and the grants being taken there by Henry Willis.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Governor Alexander Spotswood had encouraged immigration of Germans into Virginia in 1714, and they settled "in what was then Stafford Co. . . .. later Prince William and now Fauquier."  The men worked in Spotswood's iron mines, but around 1718 took grants in the proprietary in what was then Stafford County.

Beverley is best remembered for his classic <title>History and Present State of Virginia</title> published in London in 1705.

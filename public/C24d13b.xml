<note>Carter edited the clerk's draft, and changed one word in his hand as is indicated by the use of italics.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] No information about John Russell has presently been located.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] William Russell (1680?-1741) was a well-known ranger and explorer who eventually settled in Prince William County (later Fauquier). Fairfax Harrison thinks he may have been one of the rangers who accompanied Spotswood's Knights of the Golden Horseshoe. (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison,  <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William.</title> p. 204.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Bull Run is a major tributary of the Occoquan River, forming the foundary between today's Prince William and Fairfax counties, and then between Prince  William and Loudoun counties. (<cit><bibl>Alexandria Drafting Company. <title>Regional Northern Virginia.</title> [Alexandria, VA: Alexandria Drafting Company, 2002.] </bibl></cit>  Coverage of Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, and Prince William counties.)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] The Occaquan River is a major tributary of  the Potomac River that lay in Stafford County in Carter's day. Much of the river today is known as the Bull Run, and forms the boundary between Fairfax and Prince William counties, and to the west, between Loudoun and Prince William  counties. (<cit><bibl>Alexandria Drafting Company. <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Sugarland Run flows into the Potomac River in Fairfax County along the Loudoun County line. (<cit><bibl>Alexandria Drafting Company. <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] John Savage was a surveyor, later (1734) to be employed by Lord Fairfax while attempting to establish the boundaries of the proprietary. (<bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title> p. 619.</bibl>)</note>

<note id="n7">[7] Thomas Barber of Richmond County was a surveyor, and would be appointed a justice of that county in 1730, tobacco inspector in1734, and sheriff in 1736. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]: 215, 342, and 369.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n8">[8] Governor Alexander Spotswood had encouraged immigration of Germans into Virginia in 1714, and they settled "in what was then Stafford Co. . . .. later Prince William and now Fauquier."  The men worked in Spotswood's iron mines, but around 1718 took grants in the proprietary in what was then Stafford County. (See "Germantown" in <cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title></bibl></cit> pp. 207-221. and <cit><bibl>Elizabeth Chapman Denny Vann and Margaret Collins Denny Dixon. <title>Virginia's First German Colony. </title> Richmond: Privately printed, 1961.</bibl></cit> p. 33.) </note>

<note id="n9">[9] Goose Creek flows into the Potomac River just east of Leesburg in Loudoun County. (<cit><bibl>Alexandria Drafting Company. <hi rend="italics">op. cit.</hi></bibl></cit>)</note>

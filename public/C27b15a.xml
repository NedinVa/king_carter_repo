<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> State Records, Colonial Government (RG-1), Colonial Papers, 1630-1778, Library of Virginia, Richmond.  This is a heavily edited draft. The date is taken from the endorsement, but as the Council did not consider the appointment of Robert Carter II to be naval officer until March 1, 1727 (see <cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:128</bibl></cit>), the recipient's copy certainly was not sent until later in March, and may never have been sent. It does not appear in <title>Journal of the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations from January 1722-3 to December 1728.</title> (London: His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1928).</note>


<note>It is endorsed: "President's ltr | to the Commissrs | of the Customs | Febry 1726/7 | Robt. Carter appd. | Naval Offr. Rappk Dist."</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The Commissioners of Customs had first been established in 1663 and the group was reorganized several times, especially after 1688. The board was "intrusted with collection of customs both in England and the colonies." The board helped write many of the instructions for colonial governors in collaboration with the Privy Council. "Their direct connection with the colonies was through the governors, who were instructed to correspond with the commissioners, and to send them, every three months, lists of clearances, and also reports of illegal trading. The governor's agent in matters of trade was the naval officer whom he was empowered to appoint, but who was required by the 7th and 8th William III to give security to the commissioners of customs." (Louise Phillips Kellogg. <title>The American Colonial Charter. A Study of English Administration in Relation Thereto, Especialy after 1688.</title>  [Annual Report, American Historical Association. Vol. 1, Govt. Print. Off., 1904], p. 226.)</note><lb/>

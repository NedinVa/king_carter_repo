</title>

</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, June 27, 1727, concerning tobacco that he had shipped to Stark on the <hi rend="italics">Ann &amp; Elizabeth,</hi> a ship that went aground but whose cargo was saved. He reports a bill of exchange drawn on Stark, encloses a bill of lading (not present) for 34 hogsheads shipped on the <hi rend="italics">Lucia,</hi> and reminds Stark that he expects his tobacco to be sold promptly because he dislikes "Dribling lagg Sales." In a post script, he requests Stark find him several tradesmen. In a post script dated July 22, 1727, he reports others bills of exchange.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>This text revised to add the post script 8/4/03.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. Rappahannock, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter had written Stark 1727 May 19, "I Sent you in a James River Ship the Ann &amp; Eliza. Mc:Clean Master 13 hhds: of Tobbo: 10 of my own and 3 of Mr. Burwells Estate. I hear the Ship was driven a Shoar in a Storm The Cargoe all Saved and the Ship like to be got of. of this I have yet no Accot: from you."</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</note>

<note id="n5">[5] James Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official or factor of John Stark's firm  who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. Carter had noted that Read was aboard the <hi rend="italics">Charles,</hi> a Glasgow ship that was owned by Stark, in a letter to Stark of 1723 September 4. </note>

<note id="n6">[6] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<note id="n7">[7] Henry Lee (1691-1747) was a son of Carter's old friend, Hancock Kee (1653-1709). He lived in Westmoreland County at "Lee Hall" and married Mary Bland. (<cit><bibl>Burton J. Hendrick. <title>The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family.</title> [Boston: Little Brown, 1935]. pp. 329-30.</bibl></cit>)</note>

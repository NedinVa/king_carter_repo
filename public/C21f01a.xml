<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, June 1, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, June 1, 1721, concerning the freight charges being asked by ship captains in the colony, reporting that those in the York River have dropped the rate to &pound;8, and some to &pound;7. Bailey Kent, captain of the <hi rend="italics">Carter,</hi> is having trouble obtaining cargo; Carter has put aboard 200 hogsheads of the 600 Kent has on board. Captain Wharton continues to ask for &pound;8 and Carter thinks he may not obtain cargo at all. He continues that the prospects for a crop are not good because of the abundance of worms that have destroyed the plants. He sends his blessings to his young sons then in England at school under Dawkins' care.</p>

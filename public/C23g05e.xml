<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Robert Carter, Jr., July 5, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his son, Robin (Robert Carter, Jr.), then in England at school, July 5, 1723, that he was sorry not have had a letter from him on the <hi rend="italics">Carter,</hi> but understands he was away when she sailed. He reviews the arrangements for Robin's return to the colony if he has not already sailed because merchant William Dawkins has kept Robin longer in England than Carter intended. He concludes that Robin's brother Charles may return with him or stay as he chooses.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Robert Carter (1704-1732) was Carter's seventh child by his
second wife, Elizabeth Landon (Willis) Carter. Robert was sent to England to school in 1718; see Carter's letter to William Dawkins, July 9, 1718. Robert married Priscilla Churchill in 1725 and had two children, one of whom, Robert Carter III, would be known as "Councillor" Carter of "Nomini Hall." Robert Carter II died a few months before his father.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Solomon Low was the master of the lower-level school that Carter's sons attended. See Carter's letter to Low, 1723 July 5.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Benjamin Graves was the son of Captain Thomas Graves (d. <hi rend="italics">ante</hi> 1720), long a captain of vessels trading to Virginia, and a special friend of Carter. Benjamin also commanded vessels in the trade, especially the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi>.

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1]   John Zuil was a merchant and was probably the ship's captain that Carter mentioned in his diary 1722 August 1, "Zuil Saild Gave me a Bottle Snuff."  Carter recorded a diary note about him the following year as well: 1723 December 30 "mr Zuil &amp; man came back" [from church]. In what British city Zuil lived is not clear, but it may have been Liverpool because city directories of 1767-1773 list a John Zuil as a merchant, first in Cable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period.

<note id="n2">[2] The <hi rend="italics">Content</hi> was a Liverpool ship owned by John Pemberton and commanded by various masters including captains Stephenson (1721 and later) , Fowler (1723), and Morton (1727).

<note id="n3">[3] The clerk should have written "spatterdashes," a type of knee-high leggings worn over other garments to protect them from splashes and mud.</note>

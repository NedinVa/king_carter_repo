<salute>Dear sir,</salute>
</opener>


<p>
The sight of your man <lb/>
did not a little surprise me&mdash;<lb/>
Had heard of my <note target="n2">daughter</note> being <lb/>
taken ill at her uncle <note n="HA">Armistead's</note> <lb/>
before. I pray God, you are not <lb/>
mistaken in the conquest of her <lb/>
distemper. Were it not for these <lb/>
difficult rivers, I would imme=<lb/>
=diately come and see her. The <lb/>
calamitys upon my family ever since <lb/>
I saw you have made it impossible <lb/>
for my <note target="n3">wife</note> to pay her respects to <lb/>
<name type="river">York River</name>; and she's at this time so <lb/>

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
feeble in her knees she can hardly rise off <lb/>
the chair she sits in, which forces <lb/>
her to lay aside the thoughts of <lb/>
that journey until my return <lb/>
from <note target="n4">Town</note>.<lb/></p>
<p>
I thank you for the offer of your <lb/>
chariot. God willing I intend <lb/>
to be at <note target="n5">Rosegill</note> on Saturday the <lb/>
18th Instant by 12 o'clock, to make <lb/>
use of your favour. If your wife <lb/>
should relaps before that <note target="n6">[and]</note> you <lb/>
think it expedient to let me know <lb/>
it, I will endeavour to get to her <lb/>
by horseback.</p> 
<p>The proper respects of this family <lb/>
you command. Pray, my love &amp;<lb/>
blessing to  my dear girl. That you <lb/>
may all enjoy your healths is <lb/>
the constant petition  of </p>

<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now lost&mdash;from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained.</note>

<note> The nineteenth-century copyist wrote at the head of this letter: <q>[Letter without address but meant for his son-in-law Mann Page of 
'Rosewell.' It is also without date but appears in the letter-book between a letter dated Octor: 7th 1718 and the 16th of the same month.]</q> </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and state have been added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>


<note id="n2">[1] Judith Carter (1695-c. 1750) was RC's fifth child <q>and the last by  his wife, Judith Armistead, [and] was also named Judith following the first Judith who died in infancy. . . . She was the grandmother of John Page, Governor of Virginia.</q> She married in 1718 Mann Page of <q>Rosewell,</q> Gloucester County. (<cit><bibl n="B3">Carleton. <title>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 211.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[2] Elizabeth Landon Willis (1684-1719) was RC's second wife by whom he had ten children. She had their last child, George, in 1718.</note>

<note id="n4">[3] Williamsburg.</note>

<note id="n5">[4] <q>Rosegill</q> is the Wormeley home in Middlesex County; it lies between Rosegill Lake and Urbanna Creek, slightly up the Rappahannock from <q>Corotoman.</q> The nineteenth-century copyist-editor added in a note, <q>When Mr. Carter went to Williamsburg he crost the Rapph at Rosegill &amp; went thence to Rosewll, &amp; thence by land.</q></note>

<note id="n6">[5] This word was added in brackets by the nineteenth-century copyist.</note>

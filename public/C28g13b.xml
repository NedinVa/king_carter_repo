<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter uses the word "familys" in the sense of  "the servants of a particular household or establishment, considered collectively," as the <title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title> states, but Carter   specifically refers to the slave familys.</note>

<note target="n2"> By "near free," Carter means that the man has neared the end of his obligation of indenture, "the contract by which an apprentice is bound to the master . . . by which a person binds himself to service in the colonies, etc."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (<cit><bibl><xref to="Ext6">"Dictionary of  Financial Scam Terms,"</xref> 8/22/2005</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4]  Elizabeth Burwell (1718- ?) was Carter's grandaughter by his daughter, Elizabeth, and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell. She married in 1738 William Nelson of Yorktown. (<cit><bibl n="B3">Carleton. <title>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 143.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Captain James Hopkins commanded the <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> in 1727-1728. He was then working for London merchant Robert Cary. He is mentioned in Carter's diary. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] "The Lionel Lyde mentioned above as a partner in an ironworks was very active.  He was from Bristol and traded with Virginia in both slaves and tobacco.  He was also involved in the transport of felons to Maryland and Virginia.  Some of the time he was a partner with Isaac Hobhouse in ship voyages.  He
had an interest in a glasshouse.  He served as Sheriff, Mayor, and Alderman of the City of Bristol."  (<cit><bibl>John Blankenbaker. "<xref to="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GERMANNA_COLONIES/2004-09/1095041335">Germanna Colonies</xref> L Archives."  Online at rootsweb. </bibl></cit> See also:  <cit><bibl>Marie B. Rowlands. <title>Masters and Men: In the West Midland Metalware Trades Before the Industrial Revolution. </title> [Manchester University Press, 1975 ], p.76;</bibl></cit> Walter E. Minchinton, <hi rend="italics">ed.</hi> <title>The Trade of Bristol in the Eighteenth Century,</title> [Bristol Record Society, 1957.] 20:101; and John Latimer <title>The Annals of Bristol in the Eighteenth Century.</title> [the author, 1893. <xref to="http://texts.wishful-thinking.org.uk/Latimer1800/Annals1771.html">Transcript online</xref>.)</note>

<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee concerning the death of Secretary of State Ralph Wormeley, Wormeley's unhappiness with Lee's handling of his affairs and Lee's need to do better on behalf of his estate, a consignment of 16 hogsheads of tobacco, and that Lee's supervision of Wormeley's sons, then in England for their education, should be stringent. </p>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Robert Cary, December 8, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Robert Cary, December 8, 1727, to report the receipt of letters from him by various ships, and the death of Deputy Auditor Nathaniel Harrison; he suggests that his son John Carter might be interested in the post but that he does not know whether John wishes to pursue it. He is not sure whom the governor will support, and notes that Horace Walpole will make the appointment.</p>

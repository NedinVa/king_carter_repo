<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John King, July 25, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Bristol merchant John King, July 25, 1723, concerning his recent intent to ship tobacco on board Captain Stretton's ship that was frustrated because Stretton was anchored so far up the river that communication was slow. When he received King's letter of February 10, 1723, telling him not to ship to Bristol, and relating the low prices, Carter decided against the shipment. He then turns to the reports in the colony of the bill nearing passage in Parliament that will prevent the importation of stripped and stemmed tobacco that has been pushed hard by the Scots merchants, complaining that the English  merchants did not work hard enough to make the Scots trade fairly. He concludes with an order for nails, hoes, and coal. </p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to the brief heading on the draft.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Joseph Stretton commanded the <hi rend="italics">Prince Eugene</hi> from Bristol. He had been accused in August 1721 of having traded with pirates in Madagascar, and was tried in England and found innocent. Money that had been withheld from him in Virginia he recovered by petitioning the Council.

<note id="n4">[4] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.

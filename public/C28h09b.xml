There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Landon Jones was the son of Carter's sister-in-law, <note n="MJS">Mary (Landon) Jones Swan.</note> <hi rend="italics">See </hi> <bibl n="Cbibl.html#A18">"The Landon Family." Virginia Magazine. . . .</bibl> for details of the family and the English estate to which Jones's mother may have had a claim that he was pursuing in that country. See Carter's letter to Jones of <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C23g22b.html">July 22, 1723</xref> for more details about the law suit.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] "Thos. Edwards, a little petty Fogging Lawyer the Clark of our County that hath as much Mettle and more cunning for Contention then his predecessor had" Carter wrote to Landon Jones, July 22, 1723. His opinion of Edwards later changed for there are more appreciate mentions of him in Carter's diary. Edwards was clerkof the Lancaster County court from 1720-1746. Jones's mother's son-in-law, John Swan, had made an agreement with her concerning improvements to the Swan estate but her papers were destroyed at her death. John Swan's widow had married Edwards who claimed the majority of the estate.

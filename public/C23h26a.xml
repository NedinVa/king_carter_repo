<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, August 26, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, August 26, 1723, reporting the serious damage that recent bad weather has done to crops up and down the Rappahannock, on the York, and in Maryland. He adds that a short crop may benefit planters who ship only stripped tobacco before the act of Parliament banning its importantion into England goes into effect. If Dawkins plans to send the <hi rend="italics">Carter,</hi> she should sail early. He closes by writing that he hopes to see one or both of his sons before Christmas.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note><lb/>

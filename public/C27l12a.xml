<title>Letter from Robert Carter to James Bradley, December 12, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant James Bradley, December 12, 1727, to report the arrival of Bradley's letter of September 13th and that he forwarded all the letters enclosed with it. He notes the merchant's gloomy news about the market for tobacco, sends a bill of exchange, reports Nathaniel Harrison's death, and that his post of deputy auditor will fall to the patronage of Horace Walpole.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of 1727 May 17, Bradley owned the <hi rend="italics">Welcome,</hi> but little information about Bradley has been located.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The 140 ton <hi rend="italics">Welcome</hi> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on 1727 May 17. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1727. (<cit><bibl>Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Thomas Woodward commanded the <hi rend="italics">Providence,</hi> a ship owned by Captain John Hyde &amp; Company, during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1727. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194 and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia,</bibl></cit> and Carter's letter to the firm, 1723 September 17.)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Horace Walpole was the brother of Robert Walpole, the chief minister of England. He held the posts of "auditor general and surveyor general of the royal revenue in the colonies." (<cit><bibl n="B27">Billings. <hi rend="italics">et al. </hi> <title>Colonial Virginia: A History. </title></bibl></cit>)</note>  

<note id="n5">[5] James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose,</hi> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </note>

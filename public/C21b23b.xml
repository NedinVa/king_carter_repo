<title>Letter from Robert Carter  to William Dawkins, February 23, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant, William Dawkins, February 23, 1721, to chastise him seveerly for his impertinence in writing as he has done about the handling of the schooling of Carter's three young sons who were under his charge while in England at school. Carter reminds Dawkins that he owed his position in his firm to his apprenticeship with Arthur Bailey with whom Carter had lived while in England for his own education. He lectures Dawkins about the unnecessary sums he has spent on the school, and on jewelry, and refutes Dawkins' jest that Carter should attempt to keep up with Mrs. Heath in purchasing expensive jewelry. He informs Dawkins that he has directed his older son John to relieve Dawkins of the trouble of overseeing Robert, Landon, and Charles's schooling.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony 
 have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note>The controversy between Carter and William Dawkins spread over some months in 1720-1721. Carter had written before to Dawkins in terms similar to those used in this letter; see <xref to="C20g13e">his letter</xref> to Dawkins of 13 July 1720. Dawkins had begun his career as an apprentice in the Bailey mercantile firm as Carter notes in this letter. After the death of Arthur Bailey, Jr., he succeeded to the firm into which he brought Edward Athawes with whom Carter would also correspond, as would his sons after his death.</note><lb/><lb/> 

<note id="n1">[1] This Arthur Lee may be a son of Francis Lee (1648-1724), third son of Richard Lee the emigrant; Francis had returned to England to become a merchant in London.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n3">[3] When Louis Wright edited this letter for his 1940 edition, he speculated that Mrs. Heath might be a Mrs. Samuel Heath of Northumberland County. According to more recent research by Alan Simpson, Mrs. Heath probably was Katherine (Bailey) Heath, daughter of <note n="AB2">Arthur Bailey, Jr.</note> and granddaughter of <note n="RB2">Robert Bristow.</note> Bailey and Bristow had been partners in a London mercantile firm and had owned ships in the Virginia trade. Carter had lived in the Bailey household in the six years that he spent at school and would have known Arthur Bailey's daughter well. As an heir to both wealthy men, Mrs. Heath could readily afford the expensive jewelry of which Dawkins wrote Carter.

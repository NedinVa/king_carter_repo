<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] A Captain Wilson is mentioned in Carter's letter to Edward Tucker of <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C21e27g.html">May 27, 1721</xref>, as having arrived after "15 weeks passage." and in his 1723 diary.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Malt is "barley or other grain prepared for brewing, distilling, or vinegar-making, esp. by steeping, germinating, and kiln-drying."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Robert Carter's home, "Corotoman," was located on the northeastern bank of the Rapphannock River in Lancaster County close to the present-day community of Weems.  A stream called Corrotoman [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>] River ran inland west of the house. Carter built a fine house there in the mid 1720s, but it burned in January 1729. See the <xref to="http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/corotoman.html">"Corotoman" page</xref> of the web site of Historic Christ Church Foundation for more information about the house and excavation of its ruins.  ( See the <hi rend="italics">Maryland Gazette</hi> for February 4-11, 1728/29 for comment on Carter's loss. The Maryland Archives has placed its copies of the  <hi rend="italics">Maryland Gazette</hi> online. Unfortunately, page four of the issue of February 4-11, 1728/29 is missing, and that must be where the notice of the fire at Corotoman appeared; the text is quoted in secondary sources as reading: "The fine large house of Colonel Carter on the Rappahannock was also burnt lately. The particulars of his loss we can't give you, but we are inform'd it is very great." [<hi rend="italics">Garden Club of Virginia Journal</hi>, May-June 1983, p.8.])</note>

<note id="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

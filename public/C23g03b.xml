<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, July 3, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Lodon merchant William Dawkins, July 3, 1723, alerting him to a shipment of 43 hogsheads of tobacco on board the <hi rend="italics">Carter,</hi> and praising its high quality. He reports some bills of exchange of his own and others, and sends Dawkins directions regarding his sons (then in England at school). He wishes to have Robert sent home at once and Charles to come in the spring unless he wishes to come  with his brother. He informs the merchant of the recent law passed by the colonial Assembly that will limit tobacco production, outlines the arguments in the law's favor, and hopes for Dawkins' support for it.</p>

There is a nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. </note><lb/><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] This may have been Jonathan Gipson (d. 1729) who "established Gibson's Tobacco Warehouse on the Rappahannock river on the dower land of his wife, Elizabeth (Thornton) Conway Gibson"; it was located
"immediately opposite Port Royal in Caroline County. (<cit><bibl><title>King George County Virginia Will Book A-1 1721-1752 And Miscellaneous Notes</title>. [Fredericksburg, Va.: Privately Printed, 1978], 237.</bibl></cit>.)</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n2">[2]   Patrick Connelly appears on a 1716 list of titheables in Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County (<cit><bibl>"Tithables in Lancaster Co., 1716." <title>William and Mary Quarterly</title> 1st. ser., 21[July 1912]:107.</bibl></cit>)</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n3">[3] Robert Carter (1704-1732) was RC's seventh child by his second wife, Elizabeth Landon (Willis) Carter. Robert was sent to England to school in 1718; see RC's letter to William Dawkins, July 9, 1718. Robert married Priscilla Churchill in 1725 and had two children, one of whom, Robert Carter III, would be known as "Councillor" Carter of "Nomini Hall." Robert Carter II died a few months before his father.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n4">[4] Charles Carter (1707-1764), Robert Carter's tenth child with his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis Carter. He would live at "Cleve," King George County, and inherit a number of properties in that area from his father.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n5">[5] Carter means the Rappahannock River.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n6">[6] Carter probably refers to Captain James Hopkins who would, in 1725, command the <hi rend="italics">Mary,</hi> a 100 ton vessel owned by Robert Cary of London. (<cit><bibl>Survey report 6800 of Adm. 68/184, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert H. Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note><lb/><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. "Rappahannock," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note>

<note>The word "Mr." was struck out in front of Perry's name in this letter's address but the software will not permit it to be shown as struck as is done in the body of the letter.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n2">[2]  Elizabeth Burwell (1718- ?) was Carter's grandaughter by his daughter, Elizabeth, and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell. She married in 1738 William Nelson of Yorktown.(<cit><bibl n="B3">Carleton. <title>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 143.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <hi rend="italics">Booth</hi> in 1723-1724, and the <hi rend="italics">Amity</hi> in 1727. He is mentioned in Carter's diary for June 1723.  (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] The 140 ton <hi rend="italics">Welcome</hi> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on 1727 May 17.  John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728.

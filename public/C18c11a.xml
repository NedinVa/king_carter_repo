<title>Letter from Robert Carter to the Governor (Alexander Spotswood) March 11, 1718, that his injuries received in a fall from a horse will prevent him from attending the yearly meeting of the "Governors of the College" (William and Mary) to choose a new rector, and that the trustees should "think it proper to choose another Rector in my place." He adds that with the coming of warm weather, and with the assistance of "my friends coaches" he hopes to attend the General Court.</title>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and state have been added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>
 
<note id="n1">[1] The nineteenth-century copyist mistakenly added "Wm. Gooch" to the heading 
of a letter obviously entered in the original letter book as addressed only to the governor, then Spotswood, not 
Gooch.</note> 
 
<note id="n2">[2] The trustees of the College of William and Mary elected a Rector from among their own number. RC first became a visitor of the College about 1716, and held the post of Rector for many years. As the College records for this period are not extant, it is impossible to determine Carter's periods of service as rector.</note>

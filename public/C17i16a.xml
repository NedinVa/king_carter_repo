<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, 1717 September
16</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins,
September 16, 1717, that he was very pleased to learn of his oldest
son John's recovery from an illness, and expresses his hope that John
will escape the vices of the "rising generation" during his law
studies at the Temple. He adds unhappily that he seldom hears from
John but now that he will be living in town, he should have
opportunities to write.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-
Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,
Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently
there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now
lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As
they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copist
used rows of the letter "x" to indicate material that he did not copy
from the letter book.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have been
added for clarity on this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, 1720 July
13</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, July 13,
1720, concerning a bill of exchange that he thought he had drawn on
Pemberton but he  has now remembered was drawn on another
mechant. He has drawn on Pemberton for &pound;80 payable to Edmund
Jenings. He reports that Captain Enoch Robinson had offered him
&pound;8 per ton freight when Robinson first arrived, but Robinson
now has so much business that he wishes to charge Carter &pound;9
which is not acceptable and Carter will not ship by Robinson.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

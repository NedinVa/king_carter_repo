<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, July 11, 1732, concerning his review of the mechant's accounts for the Burwell estate, and especially about his ungrateful grandson Lewis Burwell's profligate spending habits and poor manners in not writing his grandfather in over two years.</p>

5 hogsheads of tobacco sold to an Insolvent which <sic corr="Carries">Carrys</sic> off &pound;129"6"9 a smart <lb/>
Article indeed that will hardly be <abbr expan="retreived">retreiv'd</abbr> by 20 hogsheads more You are the <lb/>

taking what security you <sic corr="please">pleas</sic> upon your sales for the Security of <abbr expan="your">yr.</abbr><lb/>

the effect of an incautious trust this is a melancholly Consideration but <lb/>
I Shall <del>[illegible]</del> <add place="supralinear">not whet</add> upon it any longer at Present <lb/> In my <abbr expan="account">accot</abbr> I am <abbr expan="charged">charg'd</abbr> &pound;25 for one hogshead of tobacco <lb/>
more than any five of mine produces me</p>

<p>Besides this &pound;170 paid between the 27. of March 1731 <lb/>
and the 17. of June <add place="supralinear">on Lewis Burwells notes</add> it seems he <sic corr="has">hath</sic> been with <note n="WD">Mr. Dawkins</note> for money <lb/>

Swing in any immoderate manner and I am sure <abbr expan="it is">tis </abbr> in your power to restrain <lb/>
him from having any more money than you see reasonable to let him have <lb/>
if he spends his own after he gets it into his possession he must then thank <lb/>
himself but before he has that power in himself there ought to be an <abbr expan="Account">Accot</abbr> <lb/>
Settled and a division made if this is to be the Effects of an English Education <lb/>
I don't know who will venture their Sons thither</p>

<p>Some late letters of Yours have said many good things <lb/>


<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
Of this youth that he had made a very good use of his time at <note target="n2">the univer= <lb/>
sity</note> and would be a Comfort to his relations here when they come to see <lb/>
him and that he would without fail come to Virginia this next Ship= <lb/>
ping I have <sic corr="written">writ</sic> Year after Year for his Coming in and have <sic corr="written">writ</sic> to <lb/>
him many <note target="n3">monitory</note> letters with the tenderness of a father but he turns <lb/>
his back upon me and where he has his manners I know not Certainly <lb/>
the University affords better or else I had rather breed a Son in a dark corner <lb/>
of the Earth he <sic corr="has">hath</sic> not <abbr expan="vouchsafed">vouchsaf'd</abbr> a line to me now these two years and <lb/>
when I had one I should be very angry with a son of mine if he could not <lb/>
have afforded me a better at 14 years of Age Perhaps I may be carried <lb/>
into more warmth than is <sic corr="entirely">intirely</sic> prudent however I shall again repeat <lb/>
my Solicitations to you to send him to Virginia as soon as possibly <abbr expan="you">yo.</abbr> <lb/>
can and in the mean time not to let him lavish out money that is none of his <lb/>
own And if you will indulge him beyond <abbr expan="what is">what's</abbr> proper the fault will not <lb/>
<sic corr="lie">lye</sic> at my door <sic corr="it was">twas</sic> <abbr expan="proposed">propos'd</abbr> at his going to the University to allow him <lb/>
&pound;150 a year and no more all that he spends beyond that I am sure had <lb/>
better be hove into the Sea the keeping that Estate together and the <lb/>
making the most of it has cost me abundance of Care and trouble and <lb/>
I have a very Affectionate Memory for the <sic corr="worthiness">worthyness</sic> of his dear father <lb/>
Pray God Grant him that he may imitate him in prudence and also <lb/>
other manly Virtues I am <lb/>

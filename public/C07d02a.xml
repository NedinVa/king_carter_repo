<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas Corbin, April 2, 1707</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Corbin, April 2, 1707, that the executors of Ralph Wormeley, of which he is one, have drawn a bill of exchange on Corbin to his cousin, Chicheley Corbin Thacker, which will not be sent before the next fleet. He gloomily writes further that Virginia has learned of the disasters that overtook the last fleet with many ships lost and some taken; he has suffered greatly. Because they have not heard bad news of the ships commanded by Burford and Graves, they hope the ships escaped. In a postscript, he notes that Wormeley's sons are expected by the next fleet but they do not expect that fleet before fall.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>


<note id="n1">[1] Chicheley Corbin Thacker was a long-term clerk in the office of the Secretary of State of the colony, and also was clerk to the General Court. </note>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter wrote in his diary 1727 March 14, "Captn Wilson took his leave had my Lettrs."</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Brett was master of Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker's ship, the <hi rend="italics">Princess Amelia,</hi> which had been commanded by a Captain Lawrence until he was drowned. (Survey Report 9729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Portland,</hi> a vessel owned by Tucker as Carter writes here, was commanded by John Russell. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 9729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Indian Creek lies at the eastern tip of Lancaster County at the northern side of Fleets Bay, and runs inland roughly northwest towards today's Kilmarnock. It probably was 6 or 7 miles from "Corotoman" by the roads of Carter's time.</note>

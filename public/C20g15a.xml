<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, July 15,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 15,
1720, concerning Dawkins' business affairs with Richard Lee, noting
that Lee's father "was my Intimate friend" who had charged Carter
with looking after his children which "makes me the unfittest person
in the world to go into harsh measures agst. him." He assures Dawkins
that Lee is honest but "too unsteady &amp; too careless &amp; easie"
to do business for others. Lee will pledge his estate against the
debts if Dawkins insists, but Carter points out that, after
deductions for items due Lee, there will not be much balance due
Dawkins. Carter notes that he will do whatever Dawkins wishes, but
hopes that harsh measures will not be necessary.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

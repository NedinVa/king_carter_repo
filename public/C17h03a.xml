<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copist used rows of the letter "x" to indicate material that he did not copy from the letter book.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and state have been added for clarity on this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>


<note id="n1">[1] George I, who reigned from 1714 to 1727, the first Hanoverian.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter refers to the struggle between the Whigs and the Tories which brought the Whigs to power in 1715, and resulted in a contest between factions of the Whigs for supremacy. Sir Robert Walpole and Viscount Townshend led one faction, and the earls of Stanhope and Sunderland led the other.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] James, first Earl Stanhope, replaced Charles , second Viscount Townshend, as leading minister in 1717; both were Whigs.</note>

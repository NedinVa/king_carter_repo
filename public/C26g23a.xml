</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to [Philip Ludwell], July 23, 1726, responding to the news of the death of the governor, Hugh Drysdate, the night before. He states his inability to go to Williamsburg for several days because the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> which lies before his home is ready to sail and he must prepare documents and letters to go with her. He sends instructions that the funeral is to proceed without him, and that he is notifying other members of the Council.</p>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Starke, September 4, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Starke, September 4, 1723, reminding the merchant that he shipped 51 hogsheads on board Capt. Bowman's ship and that he hopes for a better price for it than last year's. He orders cloth, sugar, and boots, and will add claret, burgundy, and champagne provided his tobacco sells at a price that he specifies.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>


<note id="n3">[3] James Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official of John Stark's firm on a trading vessel who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. He was aboard the <hi rend="italics">Charles,</hi> a Glasgow ship that was owned by Stark, by which this letter was sent. </note>

<note id="n4">[4] It has not been determined at this time (5/16/02) what type of cloth Carter is ordering.</note>

<note id="n5">[5] A half-jack was a boot ending below the knee with turned down top of a softer and lighter colored leather, pulled on by leather or string loops on each side. (William W. Burke, "Dictionary of 18th Century Clothing Terms" [www.nwta.com/patterns/pdfs/111dict.pdf, found on line 5/9/02])</note>

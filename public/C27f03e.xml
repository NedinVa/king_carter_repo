</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to John Sterling and John Zuil, June 3, 1727, a newly-formed partnership, to send them a bill of lading (not present) for tobacco that he is shipping to them on board Captain Stephenson's ship. He notes that 3 hogsheads are sweet scented tobacco, and promises more business to the firm if they sell his tobacco at a good price.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Zuil probably was the ship's captain that Carter noted in his diary as having sailed 1722 August 1. This is the only letter to this new firm that is currently (6/4/2003) extant, and no other information about these men has been located.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] A Captain Stephenson was master of the <hi rend="italics">Content</hi> in 1721, but a ship of that name was commanded by Captain Morton in 1727.  (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> pp. 92, 93, 102</bibl></cit>; and Carter to Pemberton, 1721 February 14, and 1727 June 28.)</note>

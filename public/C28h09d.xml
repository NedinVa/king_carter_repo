<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant  Micajah Perry, August 9, 1728, to alert him to the sad state of the  affairs of the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> and of its captain, Thomas Dove, whose gout has prevented him from much activity while in the colony. Carter notes that other ship catains have spread false stories about the ship's leakiness, and the ship's officers are largely incompetent, especially "Young Baggwell" who "hath proved an notorious Villain."<hi rend="italics"></hi></p>

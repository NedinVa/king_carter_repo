<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, November 29, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, November 29, 1723, reporting the arrival of Captain Keiling's ship, and that he knows Keiling will get his business done quickly if the winter weather does not delay him. He complains about the rise in "freight extraordinary" rates and Perry's short letter that arrived by Keiling. He expects another lawsuit over lands belonging to the Lloyd estate, and has written to Captain Willis to see if he might be willing to deal over it.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

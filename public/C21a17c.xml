<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Messrs. Micajah Perry, Sr. and
Jr., January 17, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Messrs. Micajah Perry
and his grandson of the same name, January 17, 1721, reporting on the
recent session of the Virginia Assembly that had sat until Christmas.
William Byrd, representative of the colony in England, was voted
&pound;400 but the governor attached conditions Byrd would not agree
to, and they can get the details when Byrd arrives. Most of the ships
presently in Virginia are from Bristol and Liverpool, and they are
not expecting the London ships until March. He comments that Bristol
is the worst tobacco market in Britain but he has received good
prices there. The deaths of James Walker and Mrs. Rostow, and the
serious illness of Cole Digges, are recorded. He concludes that he
has considered what to do with his surplus cash in the Perry's hands,
but will not call on it soon, and notes that there will be some
protested notes from his involvement with sale of slaves from the
ship, the <hi rend="italics">Mercury.</hi></p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony
 have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] The <title>Oxford English Dictionary</title> cites
an 1864 reference 
which seems the most likely meaning of Carter's words:  "1864 <hi
rend="italics">Chambers' Bk. Days II</hi>. 755/2 
In old times plum-pottage was always served with the first course of
a Christmas dinner. 
It was made by boiling beef or mutton with broth, thickened with
brown bread; when half-boiled, 
raisins, currants, prunes, cloves, mace and ginger were added."</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Louis Wright wrote, "A feud of long standing
existed between William Byrd and Lieutenant Governor Alexander
Spotswood. Byrd, as agent for the colony, opposed Spotswood's efforts
to limit the power of the Council. For details of their quarrel, see
Leonidas Dodson, <title>Alexander Spotswood, Governor of Colonial
Virginia, 1710-22</title> (Philadelphia, 1932), 144 ff." (<cit><bibl
n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p.
62.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n3">[3] James Walker (d. 1721) was a merchant in Middlesex
County who, with his brother Richard, was one of the developers of
Urbanna; he served as sheriff of Middlesex (<cit><bibl

<note id="n5">[5] Cole Digges (1692-1744), of "Belfield," York
County, came from a distinguished family. His father had been a
member of the Council, and his grandfather the governor of Virginia.
He was returned as a burgess from Warwick County in 1718, was
appointed to the Council the next year, and held the usual offices of
justice and militia commander (for Elizabeth City, Warwick, and York
counties). (<cit><bibl n="B41">Morton. <hi rend="italics">ed. </hi> 
<title>The Present State of Virginia. . . by Hugh Jones.</title> p.
239.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n6">[6] The draft of this letter ends just before the
clause that begins "the Concludeing Clause. . . ." The following
paragraph was originally dictated at the end of the preceding letter
to the Perrys in the letter book, but Carter marked it to be copied
as the concluding paragraph to this letter, and it has been placed
here.</note>

<note id="n7">[7] Carter and Robert Tucker were the agents for the
sale of slaves carried to Virginia by the <hi
rend="italics">Mercury</hi> which was owned by Francis Chamberlayne
and Francis Sitwell. See Carter's letters to Chamberlayne and Sitwell
concerning this sale of slaves on July 26, 27, and September 27,
1720, and on July 2, 1723.</note>

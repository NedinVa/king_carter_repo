<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Messrs. Micajah Perry, Sr. and Jr., January 17, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Messrs. Micajah Perry and his grandson of the same name, January 17, 1721, reporting on the recent session of the Virginia Assembly that had sat until Christmas. William Byrd, representative of the colony in England, was voted &pound;400 but the governor attached conditions Byrd would not agree to, and they can get the details when Byrd arrives. Most of the ships presently in Virginia are from Bristol and Liverpool, and they are not expecting the London ships until March. He comments that Bristol is the worst tobacco market in Britain but he has received good prices there. The deaths of James Walker and Mrs. Rostow, and the serious illness of Cole Digges, are recorded. He concludes that he has considered what to do with his surplus cash in the Perry's hands, but will not call on it soon, and notes that there will be some protested notes from his involvement with sale of slaves from the ship, the <hi rend="italics">Mercury.</hi></p>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted:</hi>  Robert Carter Letter Book, 1720 July-1721 July, BR 227, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. Printed: <cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> pp. 62-63.</bibl></cit></note><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Louis Wright wrote, "A feud of long standing existed between William Byrd and Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood. Byrd, as agent for the colony, opposed Spotswood's efforts to limit the power of the Countil. For details of their quarrel, see Leonidas Dodson, <title>Alexander Spotswood, Governor of Colonial Virginia, 1710-22</title> (Philadelphia, 1932), 144 ff." (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 62.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n2">[2] James Walker (d. 1721) was a merchant in Middlesex County who, with his brother Richard, was one of the developers of Urbanna; he served as sheriff of Middlesex (<cit><bibl n="B16">Torrance. <title>Virginia Wills and Administrations,1632-1800.</title> p. 438.</bibl></cit>; <cit><bibl>"Answers to Queries," 1<title>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</title>, 1[1893-84]:470-1;</bibl></cit> <cit><bibl n="B39">Rutman and Rutman, <title>A Place in Time: Middlesex. . . . </title> pp. 228-31.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n3">[3] "Probably the wife of James Roscow, appointed receiver-general of quitrents in 1716." (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 63.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n4">[4] Cole Digges (1692-1744), of "Belfield," York County, came from a distinguished family. His father had been a member of the Council, and his grandfather the governor of Virginia. He was returned as a burgess from Warwick County in 1718, was appointed to the Council the next year, and held the usual offices of justice and militia commander (for Elizabeth City, Warwick, and York counties). (<cit><bibl n="B41">Morton. <hi rend="italics">ed. </hi>  <title>The Present State of Virginia. . . by Hugh Jones.</title> p. 239.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n5">[5] The draft of this letter ends just before the clause that begins "the Concludeing Clause. . . ." The following paragraph was originally dictated at the end of the preceding letter to the Perrys in the letter book, but Carter marked it to be copied as the concluding paragraph to this letter, and it has been placed here.</note>

<note id="n6">[6] Carter and Robert Tucker were the agents for the sale of slaves carried to Virginia by the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> which was owned by Francis Chamberlayne and Francis Sitwell. See Carter's letters to Chamberlayne and Sitwell concerning this sale of slaves on July 26, 27, and September 27, 1720, and on July 2, 1723.</note>

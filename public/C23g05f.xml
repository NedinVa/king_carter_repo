<title>Letter from Robert Carter and [Mann Page] to William Dawkins, July 5 and 26, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, write to London merchant William Dawkins, July 5 and 26, 1723, reporting the safe arrival of goods ordered on behalf of the "children," probably the children of Carter's deceased son-in-law, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721). They complain that Dawkins has not given the children's account the benefit of the customs discounts. They send a bill of lading for 7 hogsheads of tobacco, and report a bill of exchange to Carter for expenses and enclose an invoice (not present) for goods for the children and their slaves. They request Dawkins make available &pound;10 to Isaac Lee when he reaches England, should he need it. In a post script dated July 26th, Carter reports four bills of exchange drawn on Dawkins.</p>

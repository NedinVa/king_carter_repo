<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry &amp; Company, August 12, 1731</title>

</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry &amp; Company, August 12, 1731, concerning his grandson, Lewis Burwell, then a student at the University of Cambridge. As Burwell has ignored his advice, Carter will not bother him further, but asks Perry to reduce his expenses.</p>

<p>I have already been <del>troublesome</del>  very particular <lb/>
upon every Subject only have omitted saying anything of <note target="n1">Lewis<lb/>

from him dated the 25. of January from <note target="n2"><sic corr="Caius">Cains</sic> <sic corr="College">Colledge</sic></note> he is the<lb/>

to my order he talks as if he intended to stay two years at the University<lb/>
it is in Vain for me to lay any new injunctions upon him.  the only<lb/>
restrictions that I can impose must arise from your treatment of him<lb/>
by a bridging <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>]</add> his Expences I can only repeat what I have already said to <abbr expan="you">yu</abbr><lb/>

<xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C31h12a.html">write to him</xref> by this conveniency  but it is with Expectations that he<lb/>

into any destructive courses the Effects of them will turn upon himself<lb/>
I have done the duty of a Parent by him.  I shall mix nothing else here<lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

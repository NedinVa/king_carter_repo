<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas Corbin, February 6, 1707</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Corbin, February 6, 1707, of the news of the war (of the Spanish succession) that has arrived, some through Maryland. He sends Corbin some news from Virginia including a Council meeting to lay an embargo, their hope of learning soon who will be the new governor to succeed Edward Nott, that Ralph Wormeley's sons are due with the next fleet, and that William Churchill's move to the Wormeley's estate (through his marriage to Wormeley's widow) had given most of the responsibility for the management of the Wormeley's affairs over to him.</p>

He gives details of the stay of the  company's ship, the <hi rend="italics">Providence,</hi> in the colony, sends a bill of lading (not present) for 20 hogsheads of tobacco on board the ship, and reports a bill of exchange that he has drawn to Captain Woodward.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] There is a listing of John Levett, Alderman, at the Temple, on page 49 of <cit><bibl><title><xref to="freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~frpayments/KD1740/AB.htm">Kent's Directory </xref>For the Year 1740 Containing An Alphabetical List of the Names and Places of Abode of the Directors of Companies, Persons in Publick Business, Merchants, and other Eminent Traders in the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Borough of Southwark.</title></bibl> </cit> This was probably the John Levett (b. 1688) who was a member of the Drapers Company.  ([London: Printed and Sold by Henry Kent in Finch-Lane, near the Royal Exchange: and by the Booksellers and Pamphlets Shops of London and Westminster, 1740]. p. 39. Online, examined 8/12/2005 and 6/14/2012; and <cit><bibl>"<xref to="http://histfam.familysearch.org/getperson.php?personID=I7602&tree=London">John Levett</xref>"  online examined 6/18/2012.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter probably means the ship's mooring for her time in Virginia.</note>

<note id="n3">[3]  There were two two major types of tobacco grown in Carter's day. Oronocco was "bulkier and coarser than sweetscented . . .  had a sharper leaf  'like a fox's ear,'" and was stronger in flavor "than sweetscented."  (<cit><bibl>Arthur Pierce Middleton. <title>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</title> Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.  p. 97</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4"> [4] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (<cit><bibl><xref to="Ext6">"Dictionary of  Financial Scam Terms,"</xref> 8/22/2005</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Thomas Woodward commanded the <hi rend="italics">Providence,</hi> a ship owned by Captain John Hyde &amp; Company, during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1727. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194 and 195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia,</bibl></cit> and Carter's letter to the firm, <xref to="/users/berkeley/public//C23i17a.xml">September 17, 1723</xref>.)</note>

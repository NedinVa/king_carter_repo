<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1]   John Zuil was a merchant and was probably the ship's captain that Carter mentioned in his diary 1722 August 1, "Zuil Saild Gave me a Bottle Snuff."  Carter recorded a diary note about him the following year as well: 1723 December 30 "mr Zuil &amp; man came back" [from church]. In what British city Zuil lived is not clear, but it may have been Liverpool because city directories of 1767-1773 list a John Zuil as a merchant, first in Cable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period. (<cit><bibl>"Yuil Family Newsletters," Issue #24 Fall. 1998http://www.geocities.com/yulefamily/newsletters/yule24.htm, September 30, 2004</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<note id="n4">[4] The <hi rend="italics">Content</hi> was a Liverpool ship owned by John Pemberton and commanded by various masters including captains Stephenson (1721and later) , Fowler (1723), and Morton (1727). (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> pp. 92, 93, 102</bibl></cit>; and Carter to Pemberton, 1721 February 14, and 1727 June 28. )</note>

<note id="n5">[5] A pistole was a Spanish gold coin in use in Carter's time.</note>

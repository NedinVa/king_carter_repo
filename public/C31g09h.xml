<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1]   John Zuil was a merchant and was probably the ship's captain that Carter mentioned in his diary 1722 August 1, "Zuil Saild Gave me a Bottle Snuff."  Carter recorded a diary note about him the following year as well: 1723 December 30 "mr Zuil &amp; man came back" [from church]. In what British city Zuil lived is not clear, but it may have been Liverpool because city directories of 1767-1773 list a John Zuil as a merchant, first in Cable Street, and later, in King Street. This probably would have been a son of the man Carter knew, given the shorter lives at this period.  (<cit><bibl>"Yuil Family Website," and <xref to="http://www.yulefamily.com/newsletters/yule24.htm">Yule Family Newsletter</xref>, #24 (Fall 1998).</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The <hi rend="italics">Caledon,</hi> commanded by  John Stevenson in 1729, was owned in part by merchant John Zuil. </note>

<note id="n3">[3] John Stark was a  prominent Glasgow merchant in the sugar trade. He served as as baillie and provost (mayor) from 1725-1727. (<cit><bibl>John M'ure. <title>The History of Glasgow.</title> [Glasgow: D. Macvean and J. Wyllie &amp; Co., 1830] pp. 227-228</bibl></cit> as seen on Google books; and <cit><bibl>"Provosts of Glasgow" at <xref to="http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/LordProvostsmessage/Provosts+of+Glasgow.htm">"Welcome to Glasgow"</xref>.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4"> [4] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<note id="n4">[4] The <hi rend="italics">Content</hi> was a Liverpool ship owned by John Pemberton and commanded by various masters including captains Stephenson (1721) , Fowler (1723), and Morton (1727). (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> pp. 92, 93, 102</bibl></cit>; and Carter to Pemberton, <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C21b14d.html">February 14, 1721,</xref> and <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27f28e.html">June 28, 1727.</xref> )</note>

<note id="n5">[5] A pistole, often called a doblon, was a "Spanish gold double-escudo dating from the 1530s and surviving into the 19th cent.; (also) any of various coins derived from or resembling this from the 17th and 18th centuries." See the illustration on page 5 of <cit><bibl>John J. McCusker. <title>Money &amp; Exchange in Europe &amp; America 1600-1775 A Handbook.</title> [Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press for the Institute of Early American History and Culture, 1978.],</bibl></cit> and discussion in note 3 on page 6.

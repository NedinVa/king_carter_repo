<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry, September 10, 1731</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, September 10, 1731, to cover a bill of lading (not present) for tobacco, and commenting that tobacco has been harvested but the corn crop is ordinary. He orders a pair of Cologne millstones for a mill he is building at Rippon Hall, and reminds Perry of his earlier orders for Madeira and pipe tobacco. He has read Perry's "friendly" letter to Judith (Carter) Page, and hopes that the "Irish stockings" he has ordered for the Page "people" will arrive before winter.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <hi rend="italics">Booth</hi> in 1723-1724, a ship belonging to merchant Thomas Colmore of London (see Carter's <xref to="/users/berkeley/public/C24a29a.xml">letter</xref> to Colmore of January 20 and February 15, 1724), and the <hi rend="italics">Amity,</hi> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary in 1723. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194, and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful. (<cit><bibl n="B32">Morton. <title>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.</title> pp. 18-19;</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title> p. 342. </bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. (<cit><bibl>"Notes and Queries." <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Millstones have been prepared since Roman times in the areas around the German city of Cologne. (<bibl><cit>Charles Howell.  "<xref to="http://www.angelfire.com/journal/pondlilymill/paper.html">Millstones:</xref> An Introduction."</cit></bibl>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] An <xref to="http://www.angelfire.com/journal/pondlilymill/glossary.html">American glossary</xref> of mill terms does not include "frog."  On a <xref to="https://millsarchive.org/explore/glossary">British glossary</xref>, there appears "frog box" which is defined as "used to transfer powder from Glazing Drum to barrel."  </note>

<note id="n7">[7] The spindle "is the shaft on which the runner millstone rotates." ( Theodore R. Hazen &amp; Pond Lily Mill Restoration.s<xref to="http://www.angelfire.com/journal/pondlilymill/glossary.html#anchor273708">"A Glossary</xref> of Mill Terms.")</note>

<note id="n8">[8] Carter calls his new mill a "trib mill," a term not used in England as mill historians there are not familiar with the usage. It seems to have been used in the colonies to refer to a mill on a tributary stream; a Google search today shows a number of communities with "trib mill roads."</note>

<note id="n9">[9] By the term "mill brasses," Carter meant the bearings, and Mildred Cookson thinks "The brasses referred to in the letter, - where it says these will not be needed - were usually packing brasses, and not bearings." Packing brasses were "the three brasses forming the bearing or collar (in the centre of the bedstone) for the runner stone." (See the <cit><bibl><xref to="https://millsarchive.org/explore/glossary">"Mills Archive"</xref> online</bibl></cit>; and  <cit><bibl>Email, March 9, 2016, to the editor.  Ms. Cookson is a "Mills Archive [Great Britain]  Trustee and a traditional water miller of 30 years."</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n10">109] A pipe is "a large container of definite capacity for storing solids or liquids, such as meat, fish, or oil. Now: spec. a large cask for storing wine or cider." Wikipedia, citing a book by Ronald E. Zupco, states that a pipe was half a tun which was "a large vat or vessel, most often holding 252 wine gallons," meaning a pipe was roughly 126 gallons of wine.

Zupko. <title>A Dictionary of Weights and Measures for the British Isles: The Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century</title>.<title> [Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society</title>, 1985, 168.]</bibl></cit>) </note>

In a post script dated July 8th, Carter advises Dawkins of more bills of exchange, and reports on the bad time that Captain Thomas Dove and the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> are having in the colony.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. "Rappahannock," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note>

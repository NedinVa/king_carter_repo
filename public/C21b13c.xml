<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, February 13,
1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant, Micajah Perry, grandson
of the great merchant of the same name, February 13, 1721, concerning
his annuity and the effects on it of the crash of the market
speculation known as the "South Sea Bubble." He trusts the senior
Micajah Perry to make the right decisions concerning his investments,
and welcomes the younger Perry's offer to take &pound;2000 at
interest when Carter accumulates that much cash in the firm's hands.
He briefly mentions his poor tobacco shipped in the <hi
rend="italics">Carter,</hi> but questions  that Perry has not
commented on the better tobacco shipped by Captain Wharton.  He adds
comments on the outport ships then in Virginia and the shipping
charges in effect. He concludes that he hopes to increase his
business with the firm.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter refers to the scandal of the value of the
stock of the South Sea and other companies which wild speculation had
driven enormously high in June 1720, and which was nearly worthless
several months later. Many fortunes were made and lost. Perhaps the
most succesful speculator was Sir Robert Walpole who made a fortune,
retired, and then was called to save the nation as prime minister, a
post he held from 1721 until 1742. (<cit><bibl>Goldwin Smith.

pp. 422-424.</bibl></cit>)</note><lb/>

<note id="n2">[2] Sweetscented
tobacco was one of two major types grown in Carter's day. It was mild
compared to the stronger oronocco. Sweetscented required "a typer of
soil of limited distribution" and "was largely confined to the banks
of the great rivers, the James, York, Rappahannock, and Potomac."

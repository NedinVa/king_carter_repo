<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Corotoman,"  the name of his home, on his Virginia correspondence. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note>Although the letter does not bear an addressee's name, it is clear from the text that it is addressed to a family member, and as Mann Page, Carter's son-in-law, suffered from gout, it seems likely that he was the addressee.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Kent was the captain of the <hi rend="italics">Carter.</hi></note>

<note id="n2">[2] Sennight means a week.</note>

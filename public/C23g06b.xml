<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, July 6, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant  William Dawkins, July 6, 1723, directing him to pay Captain Benjamin Graves for some supplies Graves is to pourchase for rigging Carter's sloops. In an extensive post script, he turns to an alarming report received in the colony that Parliament is about to pass a bill prohibiting the importation of stemmed, stripped, and lugg tobacco. He complains that Parliament will not pass any law that will diminish the quantity of tobacco produced in the colony. He notes that there had been a huge crop in the colony, but circumstances have reduced it greatly.  </p>

There is a nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. </note><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Benjamin Graves was the son of Captain Thomas Graves (d. <hi rend="italics">ante</hi> 1720), long a captain of vessels trading to Virginia, and a special friend of Carter. Benjamin also commanded vessels in the trade, especially the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi>.

<note id="n2">[2] Carter uses the title of "esquire" for Heath meaning he was a man of stature in the colony. He may have been Samuel Heath, a justice of Northumberland County.

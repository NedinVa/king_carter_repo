<note id="n1">[1] William Russell (1680?-1741) was a well-known ranger and
explorer who eventually settled in Prince William County (later Fauquier). Fairfax Harrison thinks he may have been one of the rangers who accompanied Spotswood's Knights of the Golden Horseshoe. (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison,  <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William</title>, 204.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Savage was a surveyor, later (1734) to be employed by Lord Fairfax while attempting to establish the boundaries of the proprietary. (<bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title> p. 619.</bibl>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Thomas Barber of Richmond County was a surveyor, and would be appointed a justice of that county in 1730, tobacco inspector in1734, and sheriff in 1736. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]: 215, 342, and 369.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Governor Alexander Spotswood had encouraged immigration of Germans into Virginia in 1714, and they settled "in what was then Stafford Co. . . .. later Prince William and now Fauquier."  The men worked in Spotswood's iron mines, but around 1718 took grants in the proprietary in what was then Stafford County. (See "Germantown" in <cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title></bibl></cit> pp. 207-221. and <cit><bibl>Elizabeth Chapman Denny Vann and Margaret Collins Denny Dixon. <title>Virginia's First German Colony. </title> Richmond: Privately printed, 1961.</bibl></cit> p. 33.) </note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to [Mr. Randall], April 7, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to [Mr. Randall], April 7, 1724, to inform the attorney that he has written the attorney general to initiate "out lawry" proceedings against the murderer, Thomas Glascock, and has let Clayton know that Randall will assist in the matter. He alerts Randall that his daughter Elizabeth Burwell's "Imprudent Match" with Dr. George Nicholas will likely produce some law suits as he is the guardian for the Burwell children, and is acting executor of the Burwell estate. He expects Randall's assistance in these legal matters.</p>

<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note>

<note>In a letter to Attorney General John Clayton,  1724 April 7, that follows two on the same subjects in the letter book, Carter identifies his attornies as "Mr. Holloway and Mr. Randall." As one letter  indicates an acquaintanceship of long standing,  it has been selected as one directed to John Holloway, and this one to Randall who has not been identified.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] "William Forrester had been murdered on November 5, 1723, by Thomas Glascock whose son Gregory was named as an accessory." Carter had noted Glascock's capture in his diary on November 13th: "Collo Barber acquaints me me he had Seizd Glascocks who had fled for Murther his Estate Coll Tarpley in the behalf of Glascocks Heir offers to Enter the Land as Escheat " The lands reverted to the proprietors, and Carter apparently managed them for some years for the benefit of Glascock's heirs; he later acquired title to the properties which are mentioned in his will.

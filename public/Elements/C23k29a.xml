<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, November 29, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins November 29, 1723, that he has learned that Robert Jones has lost his case tried in England. He informs the merchant that he wishes to be involved without his name being connected with it in another case that will be appealed from the judgment of the General Court in Virginia to England. The case was brought by a wealthy "Esqr. Hallow's," who lives near Liverpool against the heirs of Manley in Virginia. Carter recused himself from sitting on the case because he had bought an estate from Manley, and reports that Edmund Jenings's vote carried it before the council even though he is so old and infirm that he really does not know what he is voting on. </p>

There is a nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The "old Brereton" mentioned here may be Thomas Brereton, clerk of the Council in the seventeenth century. (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . .</title> pp. 45, 53.</bibl></cit>
)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] A search of "Virginia Probate and Estate Records Prior to 1800" on the Website of the Library of Virginia did not locate a Manley will that might reveal who this person to whom Carter refers might be. (http://eagle.vsla.edu/torrence/virtua-basic.html  as of 5/17/02.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Sir Robert Raymond, later Lord Chief Justice, was Attorney General in 1720. He was regarded as the foremost lawyer of his day. </note>

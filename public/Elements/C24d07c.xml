<title>Letter from Robert Carter to [John Clayton], April 7, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the colony's attorney general, [John Clayton], April 7, 1724, concerning his intention to bring an action in the General Court, as Clayton had recommended, to have the murderer, Thomas Glascock, declared an outlaw so that his lands may be granted as an escheat. He reminds Clayton that "Mr. Holloway and Mr Randall" are his attornies and will assist in the procedure for which he expects to pay Clayton as well.</p>

<note>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] "William Forrester had been murdered on November 5, 1723, by Thomas Glascock whose son Gregory was named as an accessory." Carter had noted Glascock's capture in his diary on November 13th: "Collo Barber acquaints me me he had Seizd Glascocks who had fled for Murther his Estate Coll Tarpley in the behalf of Glascocks Heir offers to Enter the Land as Escheat " The lands reverted to the proprietors, and Carter apparently managed them for some years for the benefit of Glascock's heirs; he later acquired title to the properties which are mentioned in his will.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, October 17, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, October 17, 1723, requesting his assistance in obtaining a post on the Council of Virginia for his son John in the place of William Bassett who has just died. He has just returned from a trip up the Rappahannock to the falls on which he found only poor crops. The <hi rend="italics">Harrison</hi> has arrived, and he  has heard guns and assumes others have as well. If all the ships that are expected arrive, freight rates will be lower than what he understands Perry has chartered for.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

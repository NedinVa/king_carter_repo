<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, March 6, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, March 6, 1724, reporting on the activities of Captain Adam Graves in the colony. Graves has over 200 hogsheads of tobacco on board and his men are out with his sloops seeking more, but he has decided to sail on schedule whether or not the ship is full. Carter understands from a letter from Thomas Evans that the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> and Captain Richardson's ship are bound for the colony but Carter is doubtful about their being able to get a full cargo; he will have only 40 hogsheads.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. There is a 19th-century transcript of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</note>

<note>See also Carter's letters to John Mercer, <xref doc="C28e22a">1728 May 22,</xref> and to his some-in-law, Mann Page, <xref doc="C28e21c">1728 May 21,</xref> on the same subject as this letter. </note>

<note>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft. </note>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter refers to the persons receiving commissions as justices in King George County, and to the reluctance of certain county courts to sit until they receive new commissions because more thuan six months have passed since the new king came to the throne.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Mercer (1704-1768) emigrated from Ireland where he had been trained as an attorney. "He settled at Marlboroughtown in 1726 as a practicing attorney and at once allowed a facile pen to get him into trouble with the government." He eventually lost his license to practice law, and turned to the land speculation that he had begun as soon as he reached Virginia. "He married first on June 10, 1725 Catherine Mason (June 21, 1707-June 15, 1750) only child of Colonel George Mason (16??-1716) and his second wife Elizabeth Waugh, daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Waugh."(<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William</title> p. 315;</bibl></cit>  <cit><bibl n="B24">Copeland and MacMaster. <title>The Five George Masons.</title></bibl></cit>; and "John Mercer."  http://www.rootsweb.com/~vastaffo/johnmercer.htm  11/4/03)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] John Warner was the surveyor of King George County in 1727; he laid off the town of Falmouth in 1728. Later he worked for Lord Fairfax, and prepared an important map of his holdings. (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison,  <title>Landmarks of Old Prince William</title>, 626-
628.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4]The new town of Falmouth was created by the Assembly in February
1727. Carter, Mann Page, Nicholas Smith, William Thornton, John Fitzhugh, Charles Carter, and Henry
Fitzhugh the younger were the "directors and trustees." The land chosen for the site of the new town lay
in King George County, and deeds would have been recorded in its court records. (<cit><bibl>William Waller Hening, <title>The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of the Laws of Virginia . . . . </title>[Richmond, 1820. reprint, 1969]. IV, 234-39.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, January 28, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, January 28, 1724, reporting the activities of the captains of various vessels then in the colony, and of his plan to ship about 80 hogsheads of his own tobacco, and 30-40 more belonging to the Lloyd and Burwell estates on these ships. He thinks these ships will carry the last available stemmed tobacco to England before the law banning its importation goes into effect, and he reminds Perry of his promises that this tobacco would bring very good prices. He records a number of recent bills of exchange that the merchant should honor, and reminds him that the accounts he has sent do not include the &pound;180 that has been awarded by the courts in Carter's suit against John Wise's executors. He requests that accounts current be sent regularly for his own and the Burwell estate's affaiirs.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note>At the head of the draft letter, where the clerk has written the names of the ships on which copies of the letter were to be sent, "Keiling" was substituted for "Woodward" which was struck. The software will not allow a strike-through code at this point.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Adam Graves was a son of Captain Thomas Graves [d. <hi rend="italics">ante</hi> 1720], long a captain of vessels trading to Virginia, and a special friend of Robert Carter's.

<note id="n5">[5] Carter and Thomas Wise had "traded with each other in tobacco and bills of exchange between 1707 and 1717," but Wise "neglected his duty in returning those bills that were protested." Carter sued Wise in England to recover his money, and he won &pound;180.

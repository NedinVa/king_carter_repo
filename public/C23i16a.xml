<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1723 July 4 -1724 June 11, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. There is a 19th-century copy of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. The 19th-century copyist mis-read the month as "Feby" rather than "7br." </note><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence. The name of the colony has been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note><lb/>

<note>Words and letters in italics in the text were changes written by Carter into his clerk's draft of the letter.</note><lb/>

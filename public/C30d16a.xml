<note id="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company called the Frying Pan Company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful.

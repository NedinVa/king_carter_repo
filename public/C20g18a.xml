<title>Letter from Robert Carter to James Arbuckle, July 18,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to merchant James Arbuckle, probably located
in Liverpool, July 18, 1720, concerning wine that he has received
which he considers "tollerable considering twas the Lowest price" but
condemning the brandy which was terrible. He suggests to Arbuckle
that his supplier switched brandy after Arbuckle tasted it. He adds
that he no longer drinks claret because he believes it contributes to
gout, and requests that Arbuckle send him good white wine, noting
that it does not keep well in the colony.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

<p>Robert Carter records his suffering with gout, the work being done on his plantations, the prevailing winds and other weather, visitors he received including members of his family, family weddings and births, trips to Williamsburg and the sums he spent while there, the death and funeral of Governor Hugh Drysdale and his assumption of the post of acting governor of the colony, arrival of ships with goods and letters from Britain, movement of tobacco and other crops from his outlying farms on his sloops, the loading of tobacco on ships bound for Britain, and frequent trips to his farms and mill.</p>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John King, May 27, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Bristol merchant John King, May 27, 1721, that he has received King's letters, and complains about the prices received for the tobacco had sent on Captain Darracot's ship. Nevertheless, he will send more with Captain [Joseph] Stretton to try the Bristol market once more. He asks King to settle his account with Franklyn's executors, and then to send his balance with King. He closes by reporting two bills of echange he has drawn on King.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colonyhave been added for clarity.</note><lb/><lb/>

</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, July 11, 1732, to detail the money owed to him by Captain John Hyde &amp; Company that he wishes to have Hyde pay to Perry on Carter's account because Carter is ending  his business with Hyde. An account is included as part of the letter. He mentions copies of several letters pertinent to the affair that are enclosed, but not present.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

 <note id="n1">[1] Richard Levett (d. 1740), mercer, represented Aldersgate on the London council from 1722. A mercer according to the<title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title> is a tradesman "who deals in textile fabrics, esp. silks, velvets, and other fine materials; spec. a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers, a livery company of the City of London." Levett apparently had other facets to his business besides textiles.  (<xref to="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/london-aldermen/hen3-1912/pp119-140">"British History Online,"</xref> 9/3/2015.)</note>

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

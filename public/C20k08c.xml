<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry Senior and Junior,
November 8, 1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah Perry Senior and
Junior, November 8, 1720, sending them information about the recent
session of the Assembly from which he has just returned, noting that
there were disagreements, but "both partys seem to incline to the
Govrs. Measures as farr as will be Consistent with the Countrys
ability." He turns to Edmund Jenings who has made promises, and
Carter states that "If he will not I'll endeavour to make him when I
am full Impowerd." He adds that there are rumors that Jenings is to
be Secretary [of the colony] but that his commission has not been
produced. He comments bitterly "he will be a mighty fortunate man If
nobody Else is to come in for a place of Profitt while he lives." In
a post script, he requests that the enclosed papers be forwarded to
"Col Blackestone." </p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony
 have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter had attended meetings of the Council on
November 2-5, but apparently had left for home on Saturday, November
6, because he was not present for the meetings the following week.

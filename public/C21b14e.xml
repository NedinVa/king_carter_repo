<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>


<note id="n1">[1] Louis Wright identifies Smith as a "bookseller" of
London (Wright, <title>Letters.</title>p. 78, fn 74). In the
inventory of Carter's possessions, taken after his death, are listed
the several hundred books found in his house. Wright identified as
many of the titles as he could and published the results of his
research in an article in the first issue of <title>The Huntington
Library Quarterly</title> in 1937. The books ordered in this letter
have been identified from Wright's article, and references are given
below to the page where the books appear in the article. There are
also 
references to the footnotes in <xref to="nC33inven">his
inentory</xref> where the titles are further identified. (<cit><bibl
n="A28">Wright. "The Literary Interests of the First Carters."
</bibl></cit> )</note><lb/>

<note id="n2">[2] <title>The History of the Life and Reign of Queen
Anne</title> [1714?].  This may be the title in fn. 2.19 in Carter's
inventory. Wright article,  p. 53.</note><lb/>

<note id="n3">[3] John Scott, <title>The Christian Life, from Its
Beginning to Its Consumation in Glory.</title> (5 vols., 1712). His
inventory (see fns 7.26 and 7.27) shows that Carter had several
volumes of a 1712 multi-
volume edition; the single volume edition of "Dr. Scotts works" that
he ordered in this letter may not have been available. Wright
article,  p. 57.</note><lb/>

<note id="n4">[4] James Wellwood, <title>Memoirs of the Most
Material Transactions in England for the Last Hundred Years.</title>
(2d ed., 1700). Wright article,  p. 55. This title does not appear
in Carter's inventory.</note><lb/>

<note id="n5">[5]William Bohun, <title>A Collection of Debates,
Reports, Orders, and Resolutions of the House of Commons.</title>
(1702). See footnote 12.20 in Carter's inentory. Wright article,  p.
45.</note><lb/>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, September 15, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, September 15, 1727, to inform him that he is unable to handle the sale of the slaves on Pemberton's ship, the <hi rend="italics">Leopard,</hi> because the terms Pemberton has set forth are too rigid. The captain apparently has arranged with John Tayloe to handle the sale. He reports the arrival of the governor and the proclamation of King George II, and that he is assisting Captain Christian of the <hi rend="italics">Rose</hi> in the sale of his cargo of slaves. Captain Denton of  the <hi rend="italics">John and Betty</hi> sold a slave to a man named Killby whom Carter is sure will not be able to pay and he expects Denton to reimburse him.</p>

<head>NOTES</head>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Although this letter is headed in the letter book, "Added to Mr. Pemberton's last Letter," it has not been possible to determine which letter Carter meant. The last letter to Pemberton of which the editor has a copy was 1727 August 23 and is marked "per the Carter." According to Carter's diary, the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> sailed the next day. Accordingly, this letter must stand alone.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Pemberton was a noted merchant of Liverpool with whom
Carter did much business and to whom many of his letters are addressed.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Thomas Nelson (1667-1745), a resident of Yorktown, was a merchant and was sheriff of York County in 1722 and 1723. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:12,34,184;</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl n="B30">Greene. <title>The Diary of Colonel Landon Carter. . . .</title>, p. 96.</bibl></cit>)</note>


<note id="n3">[3] John Tayloe (1687-1747) of Mt. Airy, Richmond County, who served as justice, burgess, colonel of militia, and as a member of the Council after 1732. (<cit><bibl n="B31">Ryland. <title>Richmond County Virginia. . . . </title> pp. 115-16.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] King George II (1683-1760) reigned from 1727 until 1760. ("The Royal English Monarchy." <cit><bibl>http://scotlandroyalty.org/kings.html.</bibl></cit> 11/20/03)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose,</hi> a vessel were owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </note>

<note id="n6">[6] Corotoman Creek runs in front of Carter's home of the same name in Lancaster County.</note>

<note id="n7">[7] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship often carrying slaves owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729. (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 18, n. 23</bibl></cit>; Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15; and Carter to William Dawkins, June 28, July 26, and August 22, 1727, for Denton's first name.)</note>

<note id="n8">[8] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n9">[9] A groat is a small coin worth four British pennies.</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain George Turberville, September 6, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Captain George Turberville of Westmoreland County, September 6, 1727, that he cannot send the land warrant that Turberville and Frank Awbrey want because the description of the land is too vague. Also, he expects to be paid the necessary fees because he has about 100 warrants in the office for which he has never been paid.</p>

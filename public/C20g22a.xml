<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, July 22 and 27,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 22,
1720, about "Jones's appeal" which it appears he will win; Carter is
pleased and notes "I Shall be very ready to Do That Gent any service
That may lye in my way." The remainder of the letter deals with
tobacco shipment and sales, and several bills of exchange. In a
postscript in his hand dated July 27, 1720, Carter reports some bills
of exchange, a bill of lading for tobacco shipped aboard the <hi
rend="italics">Mercury,</hi> and reminds Dawkins of his involvement
in the sale of a cargo of slaves, adding that he "had thots of Giving
You some Trouble in that affair, but have now thrown It wholly on Mr.
Perry."</p>

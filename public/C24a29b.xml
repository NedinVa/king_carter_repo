<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain John Hyde and Company, January 29 and February 15, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the London firm trading as Captain John Hyde and Company, January 29, 1724, concerning the firm's October report of sales of tobacco from the Burwell estate which has pleased him although he cannot resist pointing out that Micajah Perry sold some of the same crop for a half penny more. He comments on the possible sales of the last of the stemmed tobacco that will reach the London market soon. He reports that Captain Woodward will soon be ready to sail with about 70 hogsheads of Carter's tobacco on board, and notes the help he has provided to the captain, including his purchase of 1000 bushels of the incoming cargo of salt. He closes writing that his understanding of their last communication is that the colony's act to restrain the quantity of tobacco planted with not be allowed. In a post script dated February 15th, just before Woodward's sailing, Carter encloses bills of lading for stripped tobacco from his plantations, from the Burwell estates, and from Mr. Grayson, and reports a bill of exchange to Woodward.</p>

<note id="n1">[1] This may have been Elizabeth (Hamlin) Ravenscroft, wife of Thomas Ravenscroft who, originally trained as a carpenter, became a distinguished citizen and "held a number of public positions. He was sheriff of James City County in 1722, but in 1723 moved to Prince George County. . . . He was a burgess of Prince George in the assembly of 1727-34, and for a time in that of 1734-40, dying in 1736."(<cit><bibl><xref to="WikiTree http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ravenscroft-5">"Thomas Ravenscroft</xref>" on WikiTree, 7/14/2015</bibl></cit>; and <cit><bibl><xref to="http://research.history.org/ravenscroft/historyRavenscroft.cfm">"Ravenscroft Archaeological Site"</xref> of Colonial Williamsburg, 7/14/2015</bibl></cit>.)</note>

 <note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Samuel Hallows (Hallowes) was a great-nephew of John Hallowes, an early landholder in Northumberland and later, Westmoreland County, who was usually identified as of "Nomini" in Westmoreland County. Samuel Hallows lived in Ashworth, County Lancaster, England. The tract in which Carter was interested may have been that of 2400 acres acquired from Hallows in 1733 by Thomas Lee. Carter had written Hallows <xref doc="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C28f26a.html">May 30, 1728,</xref> that he would not buy the tract of land. ("Major John Hallowes, 1615-1657" in <cit><bibl n="B38">Norris. <title>Westmoreland County, Virginia.</title> pp. 99-102.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Randolph had recently returned from England where he was agent for Virginia.  Apparently he had traveled to the resort town of Bath. ". . . it is not known exactly when the health giving qualities of Bath springs were first noticed. They were certainly known to the Romans who built a temple there around 50 AD. . . .  They also built a public baths which was supplied by the hot springs. . . . In the 60s and 70s AD a town grew up on the site of Bath . . .In the late 17th century Bath continued to be a quiet market town. It largely depended on its springs. From 1661 Bath water was bottled and sold. . . . In the 18th century Bath became a much more genteel and fashionable place. It boomed in size. This was largely due to the efforts of Richard 'Beau' Nash 1674-1762 who was made Master of Ceremonies. Many fine buildings were erected in Bath. . . . A Pump Room was built in 1706. . . . During the Summer Georgian Bath was full of rich visitors. They played cards, went to balls and horse racing, went walking and horse riding. However the high life was only for a small minority."

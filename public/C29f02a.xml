<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> The Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, still includes the first page of the draft of this letter which bears some damage along its right margin. The other pages of it have disappeared since the 19th-century copyist had access to the letter book, and the rest of the letter text has been prepared from the copyist's transcript in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. A note has been provided to show where the copy texts change. After page one, the line breaks are those in the 19th-century copy rather than those of the original draft letter.</note>

<note>The letter book's first page of the draft bears neither date nor address. The date is tentatively assigned because this letter follows another of this date in the letter book. Carter's usual return address of "Corotoman" for letters sent to persons in Virginia, and the county and colony, have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n6">[6] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, December 12, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, December 12, 1727, complaining that he has not been allowed a discount upon the fees for 90 hogsheads sent for sale. He comments on Perry's charges for "Collo: Bolling's commission," for "Mr. Blew the lawyer," and on affairs of the estates of Nathaniel Burwell, Merchants Hundred, and the Lloyds. He concludes that he is pondering what to do with the &pound;1500 bank annuity which he assumes has come to Perry's hands because of the Act of Parliament. </p>

<p>I have the favour of your two letters of the 23d of <abbr expan="August">Augst</abbr> <lb/>&amp; 9th of <abbr expan="October">Octobr:</abbr> &amp; find I am not to have the Discounts upon my 90 hogsheads allowed <lb/>me without the satisfaction of meeting with a Convincing reason why <lb/>you deprive me of it. Admitting you are right in saying that the state of <lb/>my Cash in your hands at that time (which I can by no means agree to) <lb/>was too low yet seeing the circumstances of my Affairs <sic corr="has">hath</sic> been <lb/>larger both before &amp; since than the calls of my Occasions a much lon-<lb/>ger time than the <sic corr="disbursements">disburstments</sic> <abbr expan="you">yo:</abbr> were out of pocket for me I can <lb/>not in my way of reasoning see why I might not have <del><add place="supralinear">not</add></del> Expected the <lb/>same <sic corr="benefit">benifit</sic> from your money as you reap from mine This part of <lb/>my Argument you have not thought fit to give me any answer to <lb/>how <sic corr="far">farr</sic> this proceeding is consistent with the strictest justice &amp; <lb/>honour I Shall leave to your consideration</p>

<p><note target="n1"><abbr expan="Colonel">Collo:</abbr> Bolling's</note> commission you agree to allow me <lb/>I suppose before this <note n="JR">Mr. Randolph</note> <sic corr="has">hath</sic> <abbr expan="paid">pd</abbr> into your hands on my <lb/>Accot. the Effects of the 67 hogsheads which I am well satisfyed he was <lb/>ordered by <abbr expan="Colonel">Collo</abbr> Bolling to Do having in my hands the bills of La=<lb/>ding with such Directions upon them</p>

<p>I am under no apprehension but <abbr expan="you">yo:</abbr> <abbr expan="paid">pd</abbr> to Mr Blew

the lawyer all the money you charge me with &amp; am in no wa<add resp="editor">[nt of]</add> <lb/>sight of his receipt all that I observed was it seem'd <del>[illegible]</del> a great de<add resp="editor">[al]</add> <lb/>&amp; his Solicitation I had no Occasion of because the matter was deter<lb/>mined before by the Kings instruction which <note n="HD"><abbr expan="Colonel">Collo:</abbr> Drysdale</note> was <lb/>pleased to conceal to say no more of it</p>

<p>You are pleased to own Your Self mistaken in not <lb/>allowing the Discounts on the <note n="MH">Merchants hundred</note> <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobbo:</abbr>  &amp; to tell me <abbr expan="you">yo:</abbr> <lb/>had given <note n="NB">Mr. Burwells</note> Estate Credit for it thus <sic corr="far">farr</sic> in part I am <lb/><sic corr="satisfied">satisfyed</sic> but the broken Accot of Paget it seems is still to stand a dead <lb/>weight upon that Estate. You <del>are pleased to</del> Observe that some have <lb/>thought proper to bear that loss with a view to recommend themselves bu<add resp="editor">[t]</add> <lb/><abbr expan="you">yo:</abbr> think it will be paying too Dear for your commissions I cannot he<add resp="editor">[re]</add> <lb/>forbear to call to your remembrance the methods of your father &amp; <note n="MP">Gra<add resp="editor">[nd]</add><lb/>father</note> who never charged a broken Account to any man in the long course <lb/>of their business, one would think if other mens Examples are no rule for <lb/><abbr expan="you">yo:</abbr> to theirs at least you would pay a venerable regard. I am obliged to you <lb/>for your kind promises that in respect of the long correspondence that <lb/>I have had subsisting in your family <del>shall always prompt you</del> <add place="supralinear">You will be ready</add> to do <lb/>me all the good Offices in your power which as I receive them I shall <lb/>never fail in suitable acknowledgements</p>

<p>I shall now look forward herein I send you my Accot of <lb/>the <sic corr="disbursements">disburstments</sic> upon the <note n="LL">LL's </note>Estate for the Year 1726 it <add place="supralinear">is</add> larger <lb/><sic corr="than">then</sic> <sic corr="has">hath</sic> been Usual Occasioned by paying for Grounds &amp; housing for <lb/>a great many of <sic corr="the">them</sic> slaves &amp; I have told <abbr expan="you">yo:</abbr> often &amp; do now again that the <lb/>plantations belonging to that Estate will not Afford a <sic corr="tolerable berth">tollerable birth</sic> <lb/>for above 25 or at most 30 of the slaves &amp; this upon enquiry you may <lb/>learn from others <del>men</del> as well as from me</p>

<p>Herein I send you a bill of Exchange from Ed-<lb/>mund Bagg On <note n="RC">Mr Cary</note> for &pound; 200 it is Mr Burwells money &amp; must be <lb/>placed to his credit I also send you a bill of Exchange of my own <lb/><note target="n2">Wilson Cary</note> Draws upon your self for &pound;54:13:9 this &amp; my Accot <lb/>of my <sic corr="Disbursements">Disburstments</sic> mentioned above I desire may be placed to my<lb/>Credit</p>

	<p>By a former letter from you &amp; indeed by the Act <lb/>of Parliament for the paying of the <sic corr="Annuities">Annuitys</sic> I must conclude <lb/>my <sic corr="bank">banck</sic> Annuity of &pound;1500. is <del>now</del> <abbr expan="paid">pd</abbr> into your hands my next <lb/>consideration must be how to employ this money to Advantage I almost <lb/>doubt should I propose to let it <sic corr="lie">lye</sic> in your hands at an interest of 4 <abbr expan="percent">perct:</abbr> <lb/>you would reject it I will pause a while perhaps if <abbr expan="you">yo:</abbr> design to say any <lb/>thing to it <sic corr="Until">Untill</sic> I may have your Answer if you will not meddle with <lb/>it my present thoughts are to turn it into <sic corr="bank">banck</sic> Stock.</p>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, February 14 and
March 28, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant, John Pemberton,
February 14, 1721, that he has received the shoes, but they are not
as strong as he desires. He orders more, and is quite specific that
they are not to be black because those rot quickly in Virginia. He
 alerts Pemberton to a bill of exchange drawn on him to Samuel Bousch,
and notes that he would have sent tobacco on board Captain Hancock's
ship but the freight rate was too high. He encloses a bill of lading
 for 30 hogsheads of tobacco sent on this ship. In a brief postscript,
he reports a bill of exchange. In a longer postscript dated March 28,
1721, Carter orders 3-400 bushels of salt and 4-500 yards of strong
 Liverpool linen. He expects to ship 30 or 40 hogsheads of tobacco on
 the <hi rend="italics">Content</hi> if Capt. Stephenson will accept
&pound;9 per ton freight charge. In his own hand, Carter adds another
 postscript requesting Pemberton find two indentured servants to
 replace John Babe, a clerk, and Marget Upton, the best female servant
Carter has ever had.</p>

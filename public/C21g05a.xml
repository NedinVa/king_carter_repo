<title>Letter from Robert Carter to [Thomas Lee], July 5, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to [Thomas Lee], July 5, 1721, concerning the affairs of the Northern Neck proprietary for which Lee had been acting agent in Virginia until 1715 while the agent, his uncle Edmund Jenings, was in England. He notes that Lee had granted land to his uncle in 1719, and informs Lee that he and Jenings had reached an agreement about the payment of quit rents that Jenings owed, and that they have also agreed to refer the question of "Downings Composition" to lawyers for settlement. He asks Lee to send him payment for certain lands that Lee has granted to himself after the expiration of his power of attorney from Lady Fairfax. Carter then turns to the matter of the Ashton lands owned by "Esq. Jeoffrys, the heir of Ashton in England." The remainder of the letter is missing.</p>

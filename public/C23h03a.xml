<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas Evans, August 3, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, August 3, 1723, that he did not receive a letter from Evans in the latest batch to arrive from England. He encloses a bill of lading (not present), and briefly complains about the stemmed tobacco act. He orders sacking for bags, cloth for prizing cider, and a very strong scythe for cutting hay.   </p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

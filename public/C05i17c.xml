<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Francis Lee, September 17, 1705</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee, September 17, 1705, that he has received Lee's accounts of the sales of tobacco belonging to the estate of Ralph Wormeley for which Carter is one of several trustees. Carter complains of that "yor Sales in my Esteem hath been very mean" and that other sales have been better. He also notes what he thinks may be errors in the accounts and requests Lee clarify several points. And he reports that he has shipped more tobacco belonging to the estate and will send the cask marks and weights by another ship since the John and Margaret has sailed without giving him bills of lading. </p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

the <note target="n2">Spotswood</note> under two marks; the first my <note target="n3">Rippon</note> Crop <lb/>

Page's</note> <del>[illegible]</del> best Crop. It lies in the Middle of them. There is &mdash;  <lb/>
some hogsheads of Leaf; the most of it is <note target="n4">stemmed</note>. You must allow <lb/>
me to say from my own Eye sight of several of the hogsheads it is good <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr> <lb/>
the 12 <abbr expan="hogsheads">hhds</abbr> are also my Crops &amp; all stemmed &amp; straight laid. I &mdash; <lb/>
Make no Leaf through all my Plantations, excepting Rippom <lb/>
One would think this would render it much more valuable than <lb/>
those Crops where the prime of the <abbr expan="tobacco">tobo</abbr> is made into Leaf I am sure it <lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1"> [1] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>.

<note id="n2">[2]Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jenings' estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. Carter obviously felt its mill would be a good acquisition .(<cit><bibl><xref to="https://archive.org/stream/williammarycolle02tyle#page/n547/mode/2up/search/271">"Notes and Queries."</xref> <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278, now available through the Internet Archive.</bibl></cit>)</note>

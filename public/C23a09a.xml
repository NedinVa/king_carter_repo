<note>This editor was greatly facilitated in work on this will by Christine Jones's 1977 nearprint work, <cit><bibl><title>John Carter I of "Corotoman" Lancaster County, Virginia.</title> (Irvington, VA: Foundation for Historic Christ Church, 1977)</bibl></cit> prepared for the Research Committee of the Foundation.  The edition included a transcript of John Carter's will which this editor wass able to scan and use optical character recognition software to produce a text that he could read against the original text, saving the labor of re-transcribing the original text.</note><lb/>

<note>The clerk writing out the original will added flourishes at the end of each line that filled the space between the last letter and the right margin of the page. The editor has not tried here to reproduce these flourishes.</note> <lb/>

<note>The recording clerk in 1723 made some modest changes undoubtedly to speed his work; he frequently substituted "&amp;" for the word "and."</note><lb/>

<note>Because the original will has been used as copy text, the signatures are original and are so indicated herein by the use of bold italics.</note><lb/>

<note>For ease in reading the transcript, the editor has added a space between the elements of the will that begin "Item."</note><lb/>

<note id="n10">[10] Jennifer Drobac has written, "Simply defined, a jointure 'was a property provision for [the] wife, made prior to marriage in lieu of dower." Henry Black, author of the standard law dictionary, defined dower as "the provision which the law makes for a widow out of the lands or tenements of her husband for her support." In a review of Susan Staves's <title>Married Women's Separate Property in England 1660-1833,</title> Margaret A. Doody wrote: "In the older system that prevailed before the mid-seventeenth century, women had 'dower rights.' At common law, a widow was entitled to a life estate amounting to one-third of all the real property of which her husband had been the legal owner. Staves shows how such a provision came to be felt an unreasonable clog on an estate . . . The result was the invention of the 'jointure,' a settlement upon the wife if her husband predeceased her, as agreed upon in advance by prenuptial contract." (Jennifer Drobac. "The 'Perfect' Jointure: Its Formulation After the Statute of Uses." 19 <title>Cambrian Law Review.</title> 26 [1988], p. 26; and <title>Eighteenth-Century Studies</title>. 28[ 1 Autumn, 1994] p. 156.)</note><lb/>

<note id="n26">[26] When the portion of Lancaster County south of the Rappahannock  (later becoming Middlesex County), was separated from that north of the river in 1666, there was one official parish in Lancaster, Christ Church.

">page 482</xref> of Vol. II,  "The Assembly had, in 1660, adopted rules . . .  Each county was instructed to erect a tan-house and to employ tanners, carriers, and shoemakers. There was appointed for each house an overseer . . . To the persons presenting hides he was required to sell plain shoes at the rate of thirty pounds [of tobacco] a pair. French falls of the largest size were to be sold to such persons at the rate of thirty-five pounds [of tobacco] a pair, whilst those of the smallest were to be sold at twenty pounds."  A knowledgeable staff member at Colonial Williamsburg has emailed the editor, "The main puzzlement is, that French Falls were made for men, women, and children, and for well over 100 years.  No one can fathom any known style or type of footwear that fits that description with certainty, at that price range, that's not slippers. The leading UK footwear historian, June Swann, has never found a definitive answer as to what they were either.  Maybe one day we'll figure it out."

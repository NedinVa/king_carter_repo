<p>Robert Carter writes to the London firm of merchants known as Captain John Hyde and Company, August 8, 1723, to report a bill of exchange he has drawn on them against the account of the estate of his son-in-law, Nathaniel Burwell, to John Bagg. He reports that the damage to the crops from a recent storm has been extensive, and in a post script tells the firm of a second bill of exchange to Daniel Watts.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1"> [1] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<note id="n2">[2] This probably was John Bagge (1682?-1726), rector of St. Anne's Parish, Essex County, 1709-1711 and 1718-1726.  He had served Sittenburne Parish in Richmond County, 1711-1716.

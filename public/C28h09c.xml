<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John King, August 9, 1728</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Bristol merchant John King, August 9, 1728, to report the arrival of King's letter and shoes that he had ordered. He declines to send more tobacco to  Bristol as the market is so bad, and he orders "Bristol waters" to treat "a Distemper I have bin afflicted with these three or four Years ."</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter mentions a Captain Darracott in letters of 1720 and 1721 to Bristol mechant John King, and a Captain John Darracott's wife, Cecilia, died in 1737 and was buried at the home of her father, William Massie (Massey), of New Kent County. A John Darracott's will was probated in Hanover County (whose records have chiefly been lost) also in 1737. (<cit><bibl>"Personal Notices From the Virginia Gazette," <title>William and Mary Quarterly</title>, 1st. ser., 5(April 1897): 242;</bibl></cit> <cit><bibl><xref to="genforum.genealogy.com/darracott/messages/38.html">"John Darracott of Hanover Co., Va. &amp; his wives."</xref>  Darracott Family Genealogy Forum on Genealogy.com  examined 5/12/2010 and 12/11/2014;</bibl></cit>  <cit><bibl><xref to="http://lva1.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/F/?func=file&file_name=find-b-clas08&local_base=CLAS08">Online index of Wills/Administration</xref> of the online catalog, Library of Virginia examined 5/12/2010 and 12/11/2014;</bibl></cit>  and <cit><bibl>"Massie Family," <hi rend="italics">ibid.</hi>, 1st. ser., 13(January 1905): 202-3.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] "Mineral waters of Clifton, near Bristol, with a temperature not exceeding 74 [degrees]; formerly celebrated in cases of pulmonary consumption." (<cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.bartleby.com/81/2523.html">"Bristol waters"</xref> on Bartleby.com. 12/5/2014</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] It is likely that the clerk taking Carter's dictation for the draft of this letter forgot to enter the symbol for thousands for the quantity of eight-penny nails as he did enter for the ten-penny nails. One hopes this omission was caught when the fair copies of the letter were prepared for sending to Bristol!</note>

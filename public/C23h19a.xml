<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, August 19, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter summarizes for London merchant Micajah Perry, August 19, 1723, his recent letters to Perry including bills of exchange drawn, and his annuity. He then chides Perry for failing to inform him concerning the funds that were to be paid into Carter's account with Perry that were the result of an arbitration hearing with Wise's executors.<lb/><lb/></p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter and Thomas Wise had "traded with each other in tobacco and bills of exchange between 1707 and 1717," but Wise "neglected his duty in returning those bills that were protested." Carter sued Wise in England to recover his money, and he won &pound;180. (Survey Report 10147 describing C24/1398 part 1, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia)</note><lb/>

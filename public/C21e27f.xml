<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, Senior, and Junior, May 27, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant, Micajah Perry, Senior, and his grandson of the same name, May 27, 1721, complaining about the low sales of several hogsheads of tobacco, and stating that he expects his crops will be sold at as good prices as other gentlemen in the colony are receiving for large lots of tobacco. He hopes that a verbal message he recceived the day before about action in Parliament to remedy the effects of the South Sea Company scandals will prove to be true. Freight rates for ships in the York River have fallen to &pound;8 which he attributes to the merchants' custom of forcing planters to pay the freight. Captain Wharton maintains he won't accept below &pound;10 and Carter has sent aboard 90 hogsheads, transporting them to the ship in his own sloops; the ship has gone up the Rappahannock to Hobb's Hole. Slave sales are brisk at Tindall's Point, and Carter is relieved that he has not as yet had any bills protested for his work as agent for the sale of slaves imported on the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi>. There are about 40 ships presently in the Rappahannock and as many in other rivers. He tells the Perrys that they will learn about the threats to these ships from pirates from those reaching England. He looks forward to an account current they have promised.</p>

Printed: <cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> pp. .</bibl></cit></note><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Francis Willis (d. <hi rend="italics">post</hi> 1749) of Ware Parish, Gloucester County, who served as burgess. (<cit><bibl>"Willis Family." <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 1st ser. 5(1896): 24-27, 171-176; 6(1897): 27-29, 206-214.)</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter refers to the scandal of the value of the stock of the South Sea and other companies which wild speculation had driven enormously high in June 1720, and which was nearly worthless several months later. Many fortunes were made and lost. Perhaps the most succesful speculator was Sir Robert Walpole who made a fortune, retired, and then was called to save the nation as prime minister, a post he held from 1721 until 1742. (<cit><bibl>Goldwin Smith. <title>A History of England.</title> Chicago, etc.: Scribner's, 1949.  pp. 422-424.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Hobb's Hole in Essex County is today called Tappahannock.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] The year before Carter had acted as one of two agents for the sale of a cargo of slaves sent into the colony on the <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi> by the slave traders Francis Chamberlayne and Francis Sitwell. See his letters to them of <xref doc="C20g26a">July 26</xref> and <xref doc="C20g27a">27,</xref> and <xref doc="C20i27c">September 27, 1720,</xref> and July 2, 1723. Carter was concerned that some of the bills of exchange that he had accepted might not be good (protested).</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Tindall's Point, now known as Gloucester Point, is in Gloucester County on the York River.</note>

<note id="n6">[6] The Rappahannock on which Carter lived.</note>

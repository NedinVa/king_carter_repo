</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant  John Pemberton, February [28,] 1732, to acknowledge the goods shipped in the <hi rend="italics">True Blue</hi> arrived in very good order, and to thank him for handling several shipments of tobacco even though the merchant has been writing Carter that he no longer wishes to be in that trade. Carter sends a bill of lading (not present) for 50 hogsheads, and asks Pemberton to have Foster Cunliffe handle it if he will not. He adds remarks about the difficulties posed by the handling of tobacco required by the new inspection law, and sends a bill of exchange (not present). He encloses a letter to Foster Cunliffe about receiving and selling the shipment of tobacco if Pemberton will not handle it,</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Foster Cunliffe (d. 1767) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Liverpool who worked to expand manufacturing and the capacity of the harbor; he served a number of terms as mayor.  He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. (<cit><bibl>James A. Picton, <hi rend="italics">ed.</hi> <title>Liverpool Municipal Archives and Records. . . .</title> [Liverpool, 1907.] pp. 27, 31, 79, 90, 96, etc.</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl>Paul G. Clemens. "The Rise of Liverpool, 1665-1750." <title>Economic History Review.</title> 24[May 1976]:211-225.</bibl></cit></note>

<note id="n2">[2] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<cit><bibl n="B27">Billings. <hi rend="italics">et al. </hi> <title>Colonial Virginia: A History. </title></bibl></cit> pp. 236-39.)</note>

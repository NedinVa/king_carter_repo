<p>Here Lies Buried <lb/>
Robert Carter, Esq., an honorable man, who <lb/>
exalted his high birth by noble endow- <lb/>
ments and pure morals. He sustained the <lb/>
College of William and Mary in the most <lb/>
trying times, </p>

<p>He was Governor <lb/>
Speaker of the House, and Treasurer, under <lb/>
the most serene Princes, William, Anne, <lb/>
George the 1st and 2nd.  Elected Speaker <lb/>
by the Public Assembly for six years, and <lb/>
Governor for more than a year, he equally <lb/>
upheld the regal dignity and public freedom. <lb/>
Possessed of ample wealth, honorably ac- <lb/>
quired, he built and endowed, at his own <lb/>
expense, this sacred edifice, a lasting <lb/>
monument of his piety to God. Entertaining- <lb/>
his friends with kindness, he was <lb/>
neither a prodigal nor a thrifty host. </p>

<p>His first wife was Judith, daughter of John <lb/>
Armistead, Esq.; his second, Betty, a <lb/>
descendant of the noble family of the <lb/>
Landons, by whom he had many children, <lb/>
on whose education he expended a consider- <lb/>
able portion of his property. </p>

<p>At length, full of honors and years, having <lb/>
discharged all duties of an exemplary <lb/>
he departed from this world on the <lb/>
4th day of August, 1732, in the 69th year <lb/>
of his age. The wretched, the widowed, <lb/>
and the orphans, bereaved of their comfort, <lb/>
protector, and father, alike lament his <lb/>
<note target="n8">loss.</note>

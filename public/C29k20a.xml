<p>I acquainted <note target="n2">your son</note> in <sic corr="Williamsburg">Williamsburgh</sic> of the agreement <lb/>
I had made with <note target="n3"><abbr expan="Benjamin">Benj</abbr> Robinson</note> for his Wifes part of the Tract of Land <lb/>
at <note target="n4">Arnolds Ferry</note> &amp; told him how well pleased I should be if you would give <lb/>
your self the Trouble to appear there at the partition between the two Sisters <lb/>
that the division might be equal in respect to the Quantity quality and <lb/>
Conveniences of the Land which <abbr expan="you">yu.</abbr> know very well tht. I cannot think <lb/>
of so fit a person &amp; your son made me hope you Would readily undertak<corr resp="editor">[e]</corr><lb/>
 it &amp; you have always been so forward in your friendship towards me tht. <lb/>
I am in no doubt you Will take this trouble upon you</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson Writes me word <note target="n5">Mrs. Wormeley</note> agrees <lb/>
to Save Charges tht. this division shall be made without a Sheriff and <lb/>
a jury, that a Surveyor shall run the Bounds of the Land to find the Quantity, &amp; <lb/>
then run a divisional Line; &amp; afterwards the Choice between the two Sisters to be deter=<lb/>
mined by balloting. Major <note target="n6">Matthew Kemp</note> is pitched upon by Mrs Wormley <lb/>
to act in her behalf, &amp; I will hope you will appear in my Stead. I need not tell <lb/>
you I shall want a good River Landing, an equal part of the best of the Land <lb/>
an equal part of the timber, &amp; an equal party of the uncleared Lands; an equal <lb/>
part of the Marsh &amp; an equal part of the rest of the Conveniences</p>

<p>Mr. Robinson <sic corr="has">hath</sic> promised to be there, &amp; be as strenuous <lb/>
in getting as good a Choice as if he was to keep the Land. The <note target="n6">patent</note> is for a <lb/>
thousand Acres. Mr. Robinson undertakes it will hold out that <abbr expan="Quantity,">Qty,</abbr> &amp; <lb/>
believes within the Bounds there will be found a hundred or two hundred <lb/>
Acres more. The dividing Line between the two Sisters ought to be very, <lb/>
plainly marked. Mr Kemp <sic corr="has">hath</sic> fixed the time for this Work to the 15th of next <lb/>
Month, as agreeing best with his Business; &amp; I shall be glad it will suit you <lb/>
also. I intend to write to <note target="n7">William Camp</note> the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's <lb/>
Affairs to take a View of the Land two or three days before, &amp; to give you all the <lb/>
Assistance he can in the performance. I shall give you no futher trouble 
from,

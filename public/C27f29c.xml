<title>Letter from Robert Carter to the Duke of Newcastle, June 29, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the Duke of Newcastle, June 29, 1727, to send the Principal Secretary of State all the public papers including the Council minutes except for the most recent ones which have not been read and approved. He informs the Duke of the Council order for merchant ships to leave the colony in fleets that are convoyed well off shore by the warship stationed in Virginia, because of the war with Spain. He concludes by informing His Grace that royal customs revenues will increase substantially because of exported tobacco and a good crop in the ground, and that the colony is "in perfect tranquillity."</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> CO5/1320, Public Record Office, London, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.. This is the recipients' copy signed by Carter as is noted by the use of bold italics.  There is a draft in Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond., 84-85; over the dateline of the draft is written in a hand not that of the transcribing clerk: "For his Majestys Especiall Servece," and the same hand has added at the foot: "To | His Grace | The Duke of New Castle |His Majestys principal Secry: of State | Whitehall." There is a nineteenth-century transcript of the  draft in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Thomas Pelham-Holles, the 1st Duke of Newcastle, was Secretary of State in the Walpole government; Richard L. Morton notes that the duke carried on a policy of "`saluatory neglect' of the colonies which lasted until the Seven Years' War." (<cit><bibl n="B17">Morton. <title>Colonial Virginia.</title> p. 506.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] H. R. McIlwaine wrote in 1910, "It is true that in 1727 . . .  England was at war with Spain, but the war was one in which not much blood was shed and which was soon over." As Carter was writing in 1727, the Spanish were indeed beseiging Gibralter, but they were not successful and gave up in July.  The conflict would end in 1729 with the treaty of Seville by which Britain obtained Gibraltar. (<cit><bibl>H.R.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, March 25, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins March 25, 1721, concerning the possible purchase of some lands owned in England by the heirs of a man named Ashton. He states that John Fitzhugh has claimed since his return to Virginia that he bought the lands and left the deeds in England to be executed. If that proves to be the case, that ends the matter, but he asks Dawkins to investigate as he would acquire the property if available. He reports that the Spaniards at St. Augustine have taken men and the cargo from a ship which then escaped, and that pirates are fitting out in Santa Domingo; he hopes that protection will be provided for "the Security of our Trade." Carter has added in his hand to the draft a request for salt to be sent.</p>

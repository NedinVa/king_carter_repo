<note>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the name of his home, "Corotoman." </note>

<note id="n1">[1]  William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.

<note id="n2">[2] The gripes are "An intermittent spasmodic pain in the bowels. Usually pl., colic pains." (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary</title> online.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."  (<xref to="http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Governor_s_Council_The">"The Governor's Council"</xref> in <title>Encyclopedia Virginia</title>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] The Piankatank River lies between the Rappahannock and York rivers and was the boundary in Carter's time between Middlesex and Gloucester counties (as it is today except that Mathews County has been cut off from Gloucester).</note>

<note id="n6">[6] A calash was "a kind of light carriage with low wheels, having a removable folding hood or top." (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary</title> online.</bibl></cit>).</note>

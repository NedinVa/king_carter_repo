<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note>A different clerk has added the note "to be Copyd" in the heading of the letter. </note>

<note id="n1">[1] Mrs. Elizabeth Young was Carter's housekeeper. He had agreed  with her for one year's service in 1724 but found her satisfactory for a longer term. (Diary 1727 June 2, and Carter to William Dawkins, June 28, July 26, and August 22, 1727, for her first name.)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship often carrying slaves owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729. (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 18, n. 23</bibl></cit>; Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15; and Carter to William Dawkins, June 28, July 26, and August 22, 1727, for Denton's first name.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Carter's letters mention a Captain Brackhill in 1728 as captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rappahannock</hi>, and Captain Loxum in 1733. There  were several vessels with this name. One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726/27.  (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] John Falconar was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price.

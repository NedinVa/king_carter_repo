<p>I sent a copy of this letter by the <name type="ship">"Spotswood"</name> who sailed hence a few days ago, which I enclosed to <note n="MP1"><abbr expan="Colonel ">Col.</abbr> Page</note> and desired he would forward  it to you. In that letter is the <note target="n1">piece of copper </note>received from Dr. [Shaw]. I have heard nothing from him since.</p>

<p>The <note n="CS"><name type="ship">Carter Frigate</name></note> is safe arrived, but 300 hhds short of her loading, a circumstance which will determine her owners to put an <corr resp="editor">[end to her?]</corr> going to Virginia.

<p>I have assayed the matter you left me and find it to be copper ore, somewhat stubborn in the fire and not very rich, as affording not an eighth.</p>

<p>The <sic corr="metal ">mettel</sic> seems to be exceeding soft &amp; ductile the best properties copper can have. for want of an opportunity of working my Testing Furnace  I have not <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add> the silver; so cannot say how much it may <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add> to <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add> The mine <sic corr="lies ">lyes</sic> very commodius for <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add> <corr resp="editor">[if ]</corr> there be ore enough surely it might work <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add>.

<note id="n1">[1]  In 1728, Robert Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

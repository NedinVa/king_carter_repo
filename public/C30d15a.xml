<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note>Carter had acted beginning in the fall of 1727 as local agent for the sale of slaves from the ship <hi rend="italics">Rose</hi> owned by Pemberton and some of the merchant's partners. Concluding the financial details of the sale extended over serveral years. See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27i16a.html">Carter's letter</xref> to Pemberton of September 16, 1727, which notes the beginning of the arrangement. Details are mentioned in numerous letters to Pemberton thereafter.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Several vessels named <hi rend="italics">The Loyalty</hi> sailed to Virginia. One commanded by Francis Wallis cleared from Poole for Virginia in 1726. Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel of this name in 1729-1730 as did James Tarleton in 1731. (Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter's letters to John Pemberton <xref to="/users/berkeley/public/C30d15c.xml">April 15,1730</xref> and <xref to="/users/berkeley/public/C31h04a.xml">1731 August 4</xref>.)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose.</hi> (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C30d15a.html">Carter to Pemberton,</xref> April 15, 1730.)  </note>

<note id="n3">[3] "Thos. Edwards, a little petty Fogging Lawyer the Clark of our County that hath as much Mettle and more cunning for Contention then his predecessor had" Carter wrote to Landon Jones, <xref to="/users/berkeley/public/C23g22b.xml">July 22, 1723.</xref> His opinion of Edwards later changed for there are more appreciative mentions of him in Carter's diary. Edwards was clerk of the Lancaster County court from 1720-1746.

<note id="n4">[4] There  were several vessels with the name <hi rend="italics">Rappahannock</hi>.  Carter's letters mention a Captain Hugh Brackhill in 1728-1729, and Captain Loxum in 1732.

<note id="n5"> [5] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Joshua Franklyn, 1720 July
13</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Bristol merchant Joshua Franklyn, July
13, 1720, concerning some bills of exchange, and reporting that he
has shipped 15 hogsheads of tobacco to John King in Bristol, and had
consigned 10 more to Franklyn's cousin, but since the latter's death,
the ship's captain had "Sent me a bill of Lading very magisterialy 
Consigning my Goods to one of his ownrs." He has directed King to 
prevent this. He has not collected the small debt due Franklyn from
William Ball. He thanks Franklyn for his condolences on the death of
Carter's wife the previous year, and states, "I . . . propose to
myself to Continue in my Single State until the time comes when I
must put on Immortality."</p>

<p>The letter you did me the favour to write of the 30th of<lb/>
last month has given me an opportunity to remove the fears of<lb/>
the Nottoway Indians, by letting them know the result of your &mdash;<lb/>
Conference with the Maherines, And because I am willing to <lb/>
satisfy those Indians as to the conduct of our other Tributaries,<lb/>
of whom they seem to entertain some suspicition, I take this<lb/>
occasion to acquaint you that <abbr expan="Colonel">Collo</abbr> Harrison who has strictly<lb/>
examined and observed <add place="supralinear">on</add> the actions of our Tributaries while<lb/>
the Cattabaws were in their neighbourhood, assures me&mdash;<lb/>
that the old Cuanichee King (by which we suppose is meant<lb/>
the Tattero King) has lived on a plantation of his these<lb/>
five years past, and has little or no correspondence with<lb/>
the Saponies, and that he was so far from assisting the<lb/>
Cattabaws, that he was in very great danger of being &mdash;<lb/>
killed by one of their parties who beset his house from&mdash;<lb/>
whence he very narrowly escaped, and lay concealed in a Swamp<lb/>
<sic corr="until">untill</sic> <note n="NH"><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Harrison</note> marched out with <del>the</del> <add place="supralinear">a</add> body of the&mdash;<lb/>
Militia and obliged the Cattabawas to return back to their<lb/>
own Country</p>

<p>But the Saponies readily <sic corr="owned">own'd</sic> to <abbr expan="Colonel">Collo</abbr> Harrison that<lb/>
three of their men contrary to their express orders went<lb/>
with the Cattabaws, under pretence of guiding them to the<lb/>
Tusiaruros but it seems they afterwards altered their&mdash;<lb/>
Route and only five of them with one of the Saponies<lb/>
went to the Tuscaruroes, the rest of the party marching<lb/>
directly for the Maherines, and upon <abbr expan="Colonel">Collo</abbr> Harrison's&mdash;<lb/>
Orders the Chief men of the Saponies very frankly&mdash;<lb/>
agreed to send in these three fellows bound to <add place="supralinear">his</add> <del>Collo</del>&mdash;<lb/>
<del>Harrison's</del> house, but they being apprehensive they should<lb/>
be delivered up to the Maherines, as was indeed intended&mdash;<lb/>
returned no more to the Saponie town, but stayed with the&mdash;<lb/>

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
Cattabaws on Roanoke where one of them died, and the other two<lb/>
are gone off with them. Thus you see how little reason there is<lb/>
to make the Saponies accountable for the action of these&mdash;<lb/>
Renegades, who, as they <sic corr="joined">join'd</sic> the Cattabawas against the<lb/>
will of their nation, are now no longer in their power<lb/>
either to be punished or delivered up by them: I must also<lb/>
in justice to the Saponies inform you that, <abbr expan="though">tho'</abbr> they think<lb/>
they have had just cause to make war on the Tuscaruroes<lb/>
for the loss of so many of their men killed by that nation<lb/>
last winter, yet they absolutedly refused to join the Cattabaws<lb/>
in attacking Blounts Town as was proposed to them, declaring<lb/>
they would not rest contented with such satisfaction as this&mdash;<lb/>
Government should think fit to obtain of the Tuscarures<lb/>
rather than transgress the orders they had received from<lb/>
hence, by taking a revenge of their own, and this may<lb/>
serve to convince the Maherines of the peaceable <sic corr="disposition">dispositn</sic><lb/>
of the Saponies, and how far that nation has been from&mdash;<lb/>
assisting the Cattabaws in the mischief they have&mdash;<lb/>
done.</p>

<p>As to the Maherine boy taken prisoner <abbr expan="Colonel">Collo</abbr> Harrison<lb/>
in his Conference with some of the Chiefs of that party<lb/>
who took him insisted on his being restored, and <sic corr="threatened">threatned</sic><lb/>
them with the resentment of this <abbr expan="Government">Governmt:</abbr> in case it<lb/>
were either refused or delayed, but the boy being some time<lb/>
before sent away to the Cattabaw Town, all that could<lb/>
be <abbr expan="obtained">obtain'd</abbr>was a promise from the King of the Sagars<lb/>
Indians that as soon as he got home the boy should be<lb/>
sent to <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Harrisons; so that if any credit is to be&mdash;<lb/>
given to the promise of this Indian King, the Maherines<lb/>
may soon expect the return of this prisoner, if not they<lb/>
will see how ready this Government is to do them good offices<lb/>
even without their application.</p>

<p>This you will be pleased to represent to the Maherines as a<lb/>
proof of our inclination <del>to do ther</del> gratify them in any thing that<lb/>
is reasonable, and I hope they will not insist upon what is<lb/>
otherwise, as is that of their demand of <del>[illegible]</del> satisfaction&mdash;<lb/>

<pb n="3"/><lb/><lb/>
from a nation that has no ways injured them.

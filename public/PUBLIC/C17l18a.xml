<title>Letter from Robert Carter to [Daniel McCarty, 1717 December
18]</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Daniel McCarty of Westmoreland County,
December 18, 1717, concerning McCarty's son's progress in school
under Carter's master, noting that the boy has made some progress even
if it is not what his father had hoped for. He gives McCarty his
opinion that "It is not always the best scholars that make 
the wisest men," and counsels McCarty that it will "neither be 
just nor prudent in you to make his ineptitude the measure of 
your benevolence." He continues that he intends to send his sons to
England for a better education, that "Dick Lee's" master has been
given a good recommendation by  a merchant, and that sending a boy
early to England is better. He notes that he cannot write himself and
will not include any thoughts about politics except his opinion that
"a vigorous, judicious, honest Assembly" is needed, and that he
wishes they lived closer so that they could talk more often. He
concludes that he has been glad to hear that McCarty's reputation
with his neighbors is rising, and that he sends respects of his own
family and of McCarty's son. </p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>

</opener>

<p>Your son's improvement here <lb/><sic corr="has ">hath </sic> not
been so great as I
could wish, <lb/>and my own children's
is little <lb/>more; yet you must give me leave <lb/>to tell you the
examination he <lb/><sic corr="has ">hath </sic> passed
through I take to have <lb/>been a very partial one. Were my
<lb/><note target="n1"><sic
corr="dominie">Domine</sic></note> to be by with your young<lb/>=er
son's Domine and both
<lb/>youngsters to pass a fair tryal, <lb/>their advance in their
books would <lb/>appear to you in a  very
different <lb/>light.

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
Your son <sic corr="has ">hath </sic> been three times through
<lb/>his Grammar and I can't
believe <lb/>but some of it sticks to
him. He <lb/>came here under the character of <lb/>not being very
happy in his learn<lb/>=ing. He had
made little progress <lb/>at <note target="n2">Mr. Lee's</note>. I
wish he may an<lb/>=swer your
expectations better <lb/>in the next place he goes to; but be
<lb/>that as it will <abbr expan="it will ">'twill </abbr> neither
be <lb/>just
nor prudent in you  to make <lb/>his ineptitude the measure of
<lb/>your benevolence. It is not
al<lb/>=ways the best scholars that make <lb/>the wisest men nor
those of the <lb/>promptest parts that
prove the <lb/>most solid in their judgements <lb/>&amp;
determination. I know a great <lb/>many of my
acquaintances that <lb/>at the schools were but very <lb/>dunces,
ye<hi rend="underline">tt</hi> now in their 
man<lb/>=hood are discreet &amp; growing men <lb/>far surpassing
others that were <lb/>much their 
masters in <note target="n3">Lillie's <lb/>rules</note> while
schoolboys together. 

<pb n="3"/><lb/><lb/>
If after all your t<hi rend="underline">rya</hi>ls Dennis
<lb/>should prove but a dull <lb/>boy, I should think <abbr
expan="it is ">'tis </abbr> your
<lb/>part still to keep him thrashing <lb/>at it till he <sic
corr="has ">hath </sic> a
tolerable <lb/>snatch of the Latin tongue at
least. <lb/>But I cannot think any school <lb/>in this country
comparable to <lb/>what may be had in
England. <lb/><note target="n4">Dick Lee's</note> Master I intend my
<lb/>boys to, of whom  I have a
very <lb/>reputable character from one <lb/>of my Merchants. But I
shall <lb/>leave this matter to your
<lb/>consideration, only mentioning <lb/>a short story of my eldest
son, <lb/>whose Master did several
times <lb/>wish he had had him with <lb/>him two years sooner. 'Tis
to <lb/>little purpose we enumerate
<lb/>our losses.  Troubles we are born <lb/>to as the sparks fly
upward. <lb/>A streak of lean to a streak
<lb/>of fat makes the  best food for <lb/>us, that we may always bear 

<pb n="4"/><lb/><lb/>
about us the remembrance of our mor<lb/>=talit<hi
rend="underline">ie</hi> and that we are but so<lb/>=journers here;
and
to quicken <lb/>our pursuit after a more certain <lb/>bliss beyond
the Grave.</p>

<p>I cannot write myself&mdash;must <lb/>there fore <sic corr="wave

<abbr expan="It is ">'Tis </abbr> my present <lb/><sic

to the event of an over=ruling
<lb/>power which turns the <sic corr="councils ">councels</sic>
<lb/>of men <sic
corr="as">at</sic> it pleases.</p>

<p>I did hear you were very much <lb/>lost in the opinion of your
<lb/>neighbours, but am  glad <abbr expan="it is ">'tis </abbr>
other<lb/>=wise&mdash;could wish we had more <lb/>frequent
conversation, but the <lb/>distance
between us won't allow <lb/>it.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-
Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,
Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently
there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now
lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As
they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. </note>

<note>The copyist wrote a note before copying the text of the
letter: "[I cannot resist the temptation to copy this characteristic
epistle, as it tends to <sic corr="throw">through</sic> light on the
downright manner of Mr. Carter. He was wont, it seems by this as well
as by many other letters, to 'call a spade a spade.'"</note>

<note>"The copying clerk has unfortunately omitted the address &amp;
date, but it stands in the Letter Book immediately after one dated
Dec: 11th 1717 &amp; on on the 18th of the following
February.]"</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been
added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>




<note id="n1">[1] A schoolmaster.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The Lee referred to cannot be identified. Neither
Thomas nor Henry Lee had married
in 1717, and it seems unlikely that either would have kept a school
at his home otherwise. Carter may
refer to the name of the schoolmaster.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Carter refers to a Latin textbook by William Lily
who is known as <q>the
grammarian.</q> It is <title>Lilies Rules Construed. Whereunto are
Added Tho. Robinsons Heroclites, the Latine Syntaxis, and Que mihi.
Also . . . Rules for the Gender of Nounes,  etc.</title>  There were
numerous seventeenth- and eighteenth-century printings and
editions.</note>

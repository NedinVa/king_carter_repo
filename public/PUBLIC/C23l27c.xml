<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Downman, [December 27, 1723]</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Richmond County sheriff William Downman, [December 27, 1723], strongly urging him to do his duty in seizing the lands and property of murderer Thomas Glascock and offering to let him read the appropriate law book about the requirements in such a case. Carter notes that the seized property and lands belong to the proprietors and that he had the opinion of the governor and attorney general to that effect in an earlier case.</p>

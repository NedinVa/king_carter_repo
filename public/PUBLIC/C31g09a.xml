One would think this would render it much more valuable than <lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[]1 The <hi rend="italics">Spotswood</hi> was a  London ship <lb/>commanded by James Bradby,  1727-1732, and was owned by Micajah Perry.

<note id="n2">[2] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it.

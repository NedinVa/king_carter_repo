<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, [Novermber 29, 1723]</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, [Novermber 29, 1723], repeating an order for a summer suit, coat, hat, shoes, and accessories for his son, Robert, that he had earlier sent from Williamsburg. He has received a letter from Dawkins sent by Captain Keiling, complains mildly about the price realized for his tobacco, and reports two errors he has noted in his account. He will have the 50 hogsheads Dawkins has reserved for him on Keiling's ship sent on board as soon as it is ready. He believes all those for whom Dawkins has reserved space on the <hi rend="italics">Betty</hi> will take it as all planters want to get away the last of the stemmed tobacco before the new law goes into effect. The present crop is only one-third to one-half of previous years. He does not believe he will find space on any of the ships now in the colony for tobacco from the estate of his late son-in-law, Nathaniel Burwell. He sends his son Robert's "Service" to Dawkins, and concludes with the hope that his son Charles will soon reach home from England.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

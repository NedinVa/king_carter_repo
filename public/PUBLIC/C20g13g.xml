<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Gale, 1720 July 13</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Gale, July 13,
1720, that his tobacco sent to Gale yielded a low price; he could
have sold the 5 hogsheads of stemmed in London for enough to meet the
price realized in Glasgow for the entire shipment; he adds that he
realizes the difference in markets and does not blame Gale. Since
Gale advises him not to send more tobacco there and to use his
balance, he has drawn a bill to Edmund Jenings. He mentions a debt
paid to Micajah Perry on his behalf, and concludes with comments on
tobacco prices at Bristol and in Holland.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] John Gale (c. 1760s-1729) was a Whithaven merchant whom Carter would write a number of times times between1720 and 1729. "Like his brothers John was engaged in maritime trade. Operating as John Gale and Company, he was named as the owner of the vessel <hi rend="italics">Clotilda,</hi> built in England in 1726 and registered in Whitehaven in 1727 at 25 tons." The Gale family had many connections with the colonies, especially in Virginia and Maryland. <cit><bibl>(Gayle N.Mandell, <xref to="http://gale-gaylefamilies.com/john-gayle-the-elder-whitehaven-cumberland.html">"The Gale/Gayle Families,"</xref> extensive genealogical and historical notes available online.</bibl></cit>)</note>

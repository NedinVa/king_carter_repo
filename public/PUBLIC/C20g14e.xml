<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah and Richard Perry, July
14, 1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah and Richard
Perry, July 14, 1720, asking them to find a schoolmistress for his
younger children, and a replacement for his "Joyner" whose indenture
will expire in the spring. He adds that he approves of their charging
his account for money paid to the wife of his painter, Cotten, "an 
honest carefull Sober fellow" who plans to bring his wife and child
to the colony. He asks the merchants to try to find employment for
Adam and Benjamin Graves because their father had been "Yor.
faithfull servt." In an addition  to this letter written later,
Carter notes that his account current does not reflect a payment to
Madeira mechants that he had directed in an earlier letter, and asks
them to continue to press Mr. Cary to sell land to Carter; he wants
it because it is "Contiguous to mine . . . &amp; was my Brors.
Daugrs. Inheritance . . . ." He writes that he is enclosing an
invoice for some "selling Goods," thanks them for a gift of a box of
smoking tobacco, and requests the same gift regularly as he has
"grown a great Smoaker." He concludes that he hopes that politics "I
have done wth. for the rest of my Days" but adds that the repressions
that the colonists had attempted to redress had met with little
success at home, commenting that there were some in the colony who
"are ready to sacrafice
All That's Dear to us provided They may have a small Share in the 
honour and the profit &amp; swim Glib in the Tide of Favour."

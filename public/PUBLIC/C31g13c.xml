<p>I have understood you have both behaved your selves in<lb/>
a very <sic corr="Vilanous">Villanous</sic> &amp; base Manner; not like such Servants as you are &mdash;<lb/>
by your Indentures, tht is Diggers in the Mines. I have therefore thought it <lb/>
proper to send to <note target="n2">Mr Grayson</note> Copies of your Indentures, that he may know <lb/>
tht you are our Servants for four years from the Time of your Arrival into the<lb/>

that he should make you do it by Correction suitable to your Deserts. And to<lb/>
that End I do hereby let you know that I do appoint him your Master in <lb/>
the Absence of Me or of my sons, giving him the same Power over <corr resp="editor">[[you]]</corr> tht we have<lb/>
you pretend to <sic corr="Holidays">Holidayes</sic> &amp; what not; but I forbid it you &amp; order him to<lb/>

It seems one of you (Haweis) is a very <sic corr="profane">prophane</sic> Rogue, curses his<lb/>
Meat &amp; us that are his Masters. I order Mr Grayson not to let you have so <lb/>
much Meat as you have had. And, seeing you have abused the Kindness you <lb/>
have met with, to treat you in a worse manner than you have been, &amp; <lb/>
give you sound <note target="n3">Drubbings</note> suitable to your Merits. You shall know you <lb/>

with you to bring you to better Manners.</p>

<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee of his hopes that the sons of Ralph Wormeley, then under Lee's care, will received a good education that will make them better men to help dispell the "very Thich Cloud of Ignorance" in Virginia. He notes that he is shipping 20 hogsheads of good tobacco belonging to the Wormeley estate to be sold for the estate's account.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note>

 <note id="n1">[1] Ralph Wormeley (ca. 1681-1714) was the oldest son and John Wormeley (1689-1727) a younger son of Ralph Wormeley' (d.1701) for whom Carter was trustee after their father's death. When Ralph died in 1714, John inherited all of their father's considerable estate in Middlesex and York counties.  He married Elizabeth ? and had six children. (See <bibl n="#Wormeley Estate">"Letters Concerning The Estate Of Ralph Wormeley" in the opening page of this web site.</bibl>)</note>

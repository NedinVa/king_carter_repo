<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note>This letter was sent "open" in a letter to Carter's son John so that John could deliver it to Evans if the quarrel with William Dawkins could not be rectified (see <xref to="C21b23a">Carter to John Carter,</xref> February 23, 1721) and probably was never delivered.  See also a <xref to="C21c03b">later letter</xref> to John, March 3, 1721, in which Carter writes that he has reconsidered the matter.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter undoubtedly knew of the Manchester Grammar School, in 1721 already over 200 years old.</note><lb/><lb/>

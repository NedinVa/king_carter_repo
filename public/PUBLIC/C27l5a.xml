<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Colonel Mann Page, December 5, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his son-in-law, Colonel Mann Page, December 5, 1727, concerning the affairs of Nathaniel Burwell's estate, the stroke recently suffered by Nathaniel Harrison whose positions as member of the Council and as auditor general of the colony will become vacant on his death. Carter believes the best person to replace Harrison on the Council will be John Clayton, the attorney general, who is expected back from England at any time. He adds news about his family and their and his health, Charles's trip to the falls, and concludes with affectionate greetings to his daughter and all of Page's "fireside." In a lengthy post script he notes Clayton's arrival and that he soon hopes to hear the results of Clayton's presentation to the House of Lords about the Northern Neck proprietary.</p>

Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.

<note id="n3"> [3] Carter may mean Robert Cary (1685-1751), a London merchant and member of a family  of which many members were involved in colonial trade.

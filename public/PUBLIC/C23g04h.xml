<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Stark, July 4, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, July 4, 1723, acknowledging several letters and a sales account from Stark received during the year. Carter complains mildly about the price realized for his tobacco. He reports a bill of exchange drawn on Stark to Micajah Perry, and hopes Stark will not charge for the exchange in London. Captain Samuel Bowman will carry 50 hogsheads of his tobacco and he will ship more if he can have it ready for Will. Read.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note><lb/>

<note>The numeral "2" appearing after Stark's name as the addressee of this  letter  may mean that two copies were to be prepared.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Stark was a Glasgow merchant.</note><lb/>

<note id="n3">[3] Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official of Stark's firm on a trading vessel who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. He was aboard the <hi rend="italics">Charles,</hi> a Glasgow ship that probably was owned by Stark. Carter specifically refers to "the Charles of Glasgow" in a letter to Stark of September 4, 1723 . </note><lb/>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Holloway, 1717 December
9</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his attorney John Holloway, December 9,
1717, concerning claims by Edmund Jenings that Carter had placed a
fence on his property. Carter states that his fence is in the same
place as the land's former owner, Mrs. Whaley, had had her fence, but
if Jenings can convince him that the fence is misplaced, he will
acknowledge it. He continues that the serious injury to his right
wrist will probably prevent his attendance at the next session of the
Assembly which he understands is to meet in March. The writ against
the Lees has been received and he will make use of it if the occasion
arises. Some of Carter's comments about a proposal by Holloway for
"an equal distribution of Mr. Lee's debts among his creditors" have
been omitted by the copyist, and Carter concludes by thanking
Holloway for his services. </p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>

</opener>

<p>I give you my kind thanks <lb/>for your two late letters.</p>

<p>As for <note n="EJ"><abbr expan="Colonel ">Collo</abbr>
Jennings'</note> pretentions <lb/>of
my <note
target="n1"><sic corr="pales">pails</sic></note> standing upon his
land <lb/>it is a thing purely novel to me. If <lb/>I mistake not,
they stand on the <lb/>same place where the former <sic
corr="pales">pails</sic> <lb/>did
which he himself was the <lb/>seller of to
<note target="n2">Mrs. Whaley</note>: and why I <lb/>must not hold
the same ground that she <lb/>did
I can see no reason.</p> 

<p>Our <note target="n3">Assembly</note> it seems is to sit
<lb/>down early in March. At this
<lb/>time my right arm, <abbr expan="although ">altho' </abbr>
almost <lb/>six weeks ago hurt,
continues very <lb/>useless to me. Some of
the bones of <lb/>my wrist are displaced and my hand <lb/>quite
distorted in so much that I can
<lb/>neither dress nor undress myself. So that <lb/>I fear I shall
not be able to venture 

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
<lb/>to lie out of my own bed this winter. <lb/>what time of the
Assembly I may <lb/>be at under my
present circumstances <lb/>I cannot foretell; but whenever
<lb/><abbr expan="Colonel ">Collo</abbr> Jennings and I meet, if he
<lb/>can
convince me that my enclosure <lb/>is upon any of his land, reason
will <lb/>oblige me to make a proper
acknow<lb/>=ledgement to him.</p>

<p> I received the writ against the <lb/>Lees and shall make use of
it as <lb/>occasion is given.</p>

<p>Your other proposal about an <lb/>equal distribution of <note
target="n4">Mr. Lee's</note> <note target="n5">debt</note> <lb/>among
his 
creditors     X     X<lb/>

X       X        X        X       X        X</p>

<p>I never was one of those who were <lb/>for starving their causes;
and you <lb/>are so strenuous
&amp; diligent in suppor<lb/>=ting those you undertake, I shall
<lb/>always be desirous of depending
upon <lb/>your abilities as often as I have oc<lb/>=casion.</p>

<closer>In all sincerity, sir, &amp;c</closer>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-
Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,
Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently
there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now
lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As
they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copyist
used a series of the letter "x" to indicate omission of material that
he did not copy.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have been
added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>

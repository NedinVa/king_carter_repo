<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah and Richard Perry, 1717
October 3</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah and Richard
Perry, October 3, 1717, of his joy in learning that his son John was
recovering from the small pox, and that he hopes John will be well
enough to write soon. He continues that he was pleased to learn that
the Carter had reached port safely, and hopes that the political
situation there will bring a "peaceable &amp; lasting tranquility."
He concludes that several persons have reported the repeal of the
tobacco law, and he is shipping his tobacco prepared "the old
way."</p>

<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Minor-
Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,
Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently
there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now
lost&mdash;from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As
they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"
obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copist
used rows of the letter "x" to indicate material that he did not copy
from the letter book, and he headed this letter, "Extract of a letter
to Micajah &amp; Richard Perry."</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have been
added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Richard Perry was a partner with his brother,
Micajah, in the great London mercantile
firm of Perry and Lane.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] An unidentified ship's captain.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Carter's son John was studying law in
England.</note>

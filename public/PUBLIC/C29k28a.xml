<p>I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> your Letter of the 13. <abbr expan="Instant">Instt.</abbr> by my Sloop. It must be owned <lb/>
the <sic corr="Convenience">Conveniency</sic> of the Widow Cale's Land to yours was a temptation to you to <lb/>
buy it. From what the Widow said to me, &amp; from what others told me I had <lb/>
Intentions to send Orders to <note n="RJ">Mr Jones</note> &amp; <note target="n1">Threalkill</note> that no more Clearing <lb/>
should be made on that side next the Widow, till I could be satisfied where <lb/>
<note n="NB">Mr Burwells</note> proper Line should run. This order I now send to Mr <lb/>
Jones tht the Overseer may conform to it. <abbr expan="Your">Yor</abbr> Offer seems to be reasonable. You <lb/>
propose to let me see your papers &amp; your Title. You tell me you claim under <lb/>
Motts patent; but that I take to be your Mistake. Burwell's Claim is <lb/>
under Mott's patent, &amp; yours I believe is under Catlet's which must be owned <lb/>
to be the Elder, if the Widow's Title comes regularly to her. You were Over:<lb/>
seer of my Affairs when <note target="n2">Savage</note> made his Survey, &amp; I am apt to think were <lb/>
at it. My directions to Savage were, tht. the Owners of the neighbouring Lands <lb/>
might have Notice, that he would lay it out in a <sic corr="public">publick</sic> Manner, &amp; <lb/>
I have heard several times that Cale was at it &amp; did not oppose his running <lb/>
that Line. I believe all this you know. I must defend my <note target="n3">Grandson's</note> <lb/>
Lands as well as I can; but where things are plain against me, I should <lb/>
rather <sic corr="choose">chuse</sic> to compose <add place="supralinear">things</add> in an amicable way; <add place="supralinear">the Law, as <abbr expan="you">yo</abbr> say, ought to be the Last Resort &amp; is so to all peaceable <add place="supralinear">minds</add></add>  And if it appears we have <lb/>
cleared into the Widow's Bounds tht she <sic corr="has">hath</sic> a just Claim to I shall be willing <lb/>
to purchase the Ground tht we have cleared, or rather to the Bounds Savage gave <lb/>
us. This I think is as fair an Offer as I can make, &amp; I <sic corr="beleive">beleve</sic> you will think so <lb/>
too. The Ground already cleared I reckon is but a small piece, &amp; all taken in <lb/>
within the Widow's Bounds  not very large. I write to Mr Jones to this purpose <lb/>
&amp; am

<p>Robert Carter writes London merchant Thomas Corbin concerning various problems, including tobacco sales, of the estate of Ralph Wormeley, for which he is one of several trustees. He reports that he is shipping 12 hogsheads of tobacco, and will ship more, all for the sale and benefit of the estate. He thanks Corbin for sending news, comments on the lamentable death of King William and expresses the hope that the nation will prosper under Queen Anne, especially in the fighting with France.</p>

 have been added for clarity.</note>

<p>Robert Carter writes to Sir Richard Everard, governor of the colony of North Carolina, July 24, 1727, in response to Everard's communication concerning persons accused of piracy apprehended in that colony. Carter informs Everard that he has set a trial date of August 15, 1727, in the vice admiralty court, and that he is sending the court's marshall to North Carolina to bring the prisoners to Williamsburg.</p>

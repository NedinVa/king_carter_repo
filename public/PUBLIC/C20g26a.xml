<p>Robert Carter and his partner, Robert Tucker, write to Messrs.
Francis Chamberlayne and [Francis] Sitwell, July 26, 1720, concerning
the details of their sale to date of a cargo of slaves on the slave
traders ship <hi rend="italics">Mercury,</hi> reporting bills of
exchange for over
&pound;5036 and expenses of &pound;985, and estimating the total
sales will be about &pound;10,000. They complain that the cargo had 
"boys &amp; Girlls so very much exceeding all manner of Proportion to
the men &amp; Women" which hurt the sales. In conclusion, they report
how they have split responsibility for the bills of exchange.</p>

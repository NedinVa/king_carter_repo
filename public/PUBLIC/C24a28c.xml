<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, January 28, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, January 28, 1724, concerning the affairs of the proprietors of the Northern Neck, sending a copy (not present) of a letter Perry cannot locate in his files, and reminding Perry of his activities and law suits to benefit the proprietors in the administration of the estate in the colony. He mentions "a great Enterprizeing Genious among us" but wishes Perry to guess who this person is, and concludes by referring Perry to a letter of July 26, 1723,  that dealt with the propriewtors' affairs.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note>At the head of the draft letter, where the clerk has written the names of the ships on which copies of the letter were to be sent, "Keiling" was substituted for "Woodward" which was struck. The software will not allow a strike-through code at this point.</note>

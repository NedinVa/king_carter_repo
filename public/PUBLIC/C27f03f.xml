<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter wrote in his diary March 14, 1727, "Captn Wilson took his leave had my Lettrs."</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Brett was master of Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker's ship, the <hi rend="italics">Princess Amelia,</hi> which had been commanded by a Captain Lawrence until he was drowned. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 9729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Portland,</hi> a vessel owned by Tucker as Carter writes here, was commanded by John Russell. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 9729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Indian Creek lies at the eastern tip of Lancaster County at the northern side of Fleets Bay, and runs inland roughly northwest towards today's Kilmarnock. It probably was 6 or 7 miles from "Corotoman" by the roads of Carter's time. (<cit><bibl n="B29">Miller. <title>Place-Names . . . . </title>p. 72.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (<cit><bibl><xref to="Ext6">"Dictionary of  Financial Scam Terms,"</xref> 8/22/2005</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] <cit><bibl>Elizabeth Donnan's <title><xref to="">Documents Illustrative</xref> of the History of the Slave Trade to America. Volume II. The Eighteenth Century</title> (Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1930, and a later edition: Buffalo, NY: William S. Hein &amp; Co., Inc., 2002)</bibl></cit> contains a good many references to a slave ship named the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> a brigantine, owned in Bristol. and trading to Africa, the Caribbean, and the British colonies in North America. Her captain in 1727 was William Barry. " On October 7, 1725, a group of Bristol merchants, who then dominated the Biafra trade, directed Captain William Barry of the <title>Dispatch</title> to buy 240 'Choice slaves' from the obscure port of Andoni."

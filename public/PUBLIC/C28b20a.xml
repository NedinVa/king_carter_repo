<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose,</hi> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </note>

<note id="n2">[2] Robert Carter's home, "Corotoman," was located on the bank of the Rapphannock River in Lancaster County close to the present-day community of Weems. A creek known today as Carter's Creek ran inland near the house.
</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> was a London ship owned by merchant Robert Cary and commanded by Thomas Price. (See Carter to Samuel Smith, January 22, 1728.)</note>

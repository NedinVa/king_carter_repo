</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Peter Leheup, the colony's agent in London, July 24, 1727, to infoirm him that he is sending to the Board of Trade the naval officer's returns for the Accomac district which had not been sent with the earlier group of "Publick Papers" because the district lies across Chesapeake Bay. He also advises Leheup of the death of Edmund Jenings on July 5, 1727.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Peter Leheup, an English Treasury clerk, was Virginia's (1722-1754)  and other colonies' agent in England for many years. "Peter Leheup was one of those almost invisible behind-the scenes personalities whose exsposure reveals so much about the character of eighteenth-century society and administration."  He became underclerk (later, chief clerk) at the Treasury in 1721, and married that year "Clara the daughter of William Lowndes, secretary of the treasury. . . . Very early his father-in-law . . .  made him a comptroller of exchequer bills. In addition, he served for decades (c. 1721-1742) as deputy to Horatio Walpole in his capacity as Auditor-General of Plantation Revenues." (<cit><bibl>Jacob M. Price, "The Excise Affair Revisited:  Administrative and Colonial Dimensions of a Parliamentary Crisis" in Stephen Barlow Baxter, <hi rend="italics">ed.</hi> <title>England's Rise to Greatness, 1660-1763.</title> [Los Angles:  University of California Press, 1983] 274-5</bibl></cit>; and (<cit><bibl n="B22">Price. <title>Perry of London. . . . </title> pp. 75-77, 80, 83.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The London ship  <hi rend="italics">Williamsburgh</hi> was a large vessel of 550 tons and carried a crew of 26 men. Charles Rogers commanded her in 1727-29.  (<cit><bibl>Adm 68/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Established in 1696 as successor to a similar body, the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations was "an advisory group, subordinate to king and Privy Council, and with no executive, financial, or penalizing powers, the Board of Trade was nevertheless able . . . to exert a far reaching and often determining influence in colonial matters. . . . It prepared the royal instructions for the governors overseas. . . ." (<cit><bibl>Henry Hartwell, James Blair, and Edward Chilton.

<note id="n4">[4] The <hi rend="italics">Marlborough</hi> was a vessel of 100 tons and 14 men, commanded by George Buckeridge (Buckbridge). In a letter to London merchant John Falconar<xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27g24d.html"> July 24,  1727,</xref> Carter refers to this vessel as "yor. Marlborrough."

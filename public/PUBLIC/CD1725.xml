This festival marked the mid-way point between the Winter Solstice and the Spring Equinox. The term "Imbolc" translates as either "in milk" or "in the belly," and marked the birth and nursing of the spring lambs as a sign of the first stirrings of spring in the middle of winter. It may also have been celebrated with the lighting of candles, as slightly longer days begin to be noticable at this time of year."

In June, Carter would learn that Burch and several others had stolen a gun and hidden it in the woods. In July Carter won a judgement against Burch for running away, and because Burch confessed "that he is totally ignorant of and unable to perform the trade &amp; misteries of a house carpenter for which he entered into Covenant with his sd Master in Great Britain."

<note id="n15.7"> [15.7] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to the Earl of Orkney, December 12, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the non-resident governor of Virginia, the Earl of Orkney, December 12, 1727, thanking him for two letters and for his expression of satisfaction with Carter's administration of the colony while president. He sends two bills of exchange, one for the governor's salary and one for a portion of the fees to which Orkney is entitled, explaining that he will have Commissary James Blair review the accounts on Orkney's behalf. He solicits Orkey's support for his son Charles to succeed his brother Robert as naval officer [of the Rappahannock] when Robert moves to the Potomac. He closes the letter with comments on the selection of a successor of Nathaniel Harrison as deputy auditor of the colony.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note>The last paragraph of the letter was drafted as an insertion headed "A clause to be added to my Ld Orkneys letter" and it has been placed as intended.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] A moiety is one of two approximately equal portions.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Although the text for the following paragraph of the draft is contiguous at this point, the clerk inserted the asterisk which must have been a signal to begin a new paragraph as the subject changes completely.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Carter refers to Christopher Robinson who had been the naval officer of the Rappahannock River and who had died prior to a Council meeting of March 1, 1727. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:128. </bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Charles Carter (1707-1764) was Robert Carter's tenth child; his mother was Carter's second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis Carter. Charles would live at "Cleve," King George County, and inherit a number of properties in that area from his father. (<cit><bibl n="B3">Carleton. <title>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 340;</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl n="B32">Morton. <title>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.</title></bibl></cit> Numerous references.)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Horace Walpole was the brother of Robert Walpole, the chief minister of England. He held the posts of "auditor general and surveyor general of the royal revenue in the colonies." (<cit><bibl n="B27">Billings. <hi rend="italics">et al. </hi> <title>Colonial Virginia: A History. </title></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose,</hi> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to  William Cage, Esqr.,  June 30, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the trustee of the Fairfax estate,William Cage, of County Kent, England, June 30, 1724, concerning the possibility of obtaining a new lease of the agency of the Northern Neck proprietary. He observes that he  makes no money at all from his lease because rents, when he can collect them, are paid in tobacco the value of which is  very low, and which rents are further devalued by cheating tax collectors and planters who falsely mark tobacco casks which they fill with "trash."</p>

<p>I have already given you the trouble <lb/>of a long letter to day <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic </hi>]</add> this please to receive in answer to <lb/>some other parts of your letter you tell me you are ready <lb/>to treat with me for a further <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/#Northern Neck"> <sic corr="lease ">leas</sic></xref> I have accordingly im=<lb/><sic corr="powered ">powred</sic> <note n="MP2">Mr Perry</note> to transact it with you for eight or ten <lb/>years longer if <note n="TF">his Lordship</note> and you think fit not in expec=<lb/>tation of living through that time but in hopes my son <lb/>may be able to serve you after my death. I flatter my self <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic </hi>]</add> you <lb/>will be so generous you will abate me the <sic corr="odd ">od</sic> twenty pound <lb/>per Annum which was more <sic corr="than ">then</sic> <note n="EJ"><abbr expan="Colonel ">Col:</abbr> Jennings</note> gave, you <lb/>know the fate he <sic corr="has ">hath </sic> met with in your business a consi=<lb/>derable part of his ruin is owing to it I can truly say I do <lb/>not get the <sic corr="money ">mony</sic> by your estate I give you for it and all the <lb/>trouble I have <add place="supralinear">been</add> at in the management of it which is abunda<add place="supralinear">nce</add> <lb/><sic corr="has ">hath </sic> been thus far entirely given away, my greatest hopes <lb/>are of some time or another meeting with a hit for Tobo. that <lb/>may make me amends.</p>

<p>I have said a great deal to you to convince you of <lb/>my hard bargain; Mr Perry <sic corr="pretty ">pritty</sic> well knows the <lb/>circumstances of the affair the poor value of the Tobo. your <lb/>rents are <sic corr="paid ">payd</sic> in the great difficulty &amp; charge of getting <lb/>it together the baseness &amp; frauds of Collectors &amp; officers the <lb/>cheats of the Planters in paying away their trash &amp; false <lb/><note target="n1">tareing</note> their Cask <sic corr="add">ad </sic>to all this the great quantities of <lb/>land that are still <sic corr="unppaid ">unpay'd</sic> for which I have yet been <lb/>able to get no rents from and am as far from doing <lb/>of it as I was the first hour I was concerned.

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note>There are two recipient's copies of this letter. The conjoined address leaf of the text above reads: "To | Wm. Cage Esqr | At Milgate | In the parish of Bearshed | In the County of | Kent | per The Prins. Carolina | Capt. Holladay." It is endorsed in Cage's handwriting, "June the 30th 1724 | Coll Carter."  The second is marked "Copy" at the foot and is dated July 9, 1724. Its address leaf reads "To be left with Mr. Micajh. Perry | LONDON Per the Spotswood | Capt. Bagwell." Both copies are signed by Carter (indicated by the use of bold italics) and sealed with his arms. </note>

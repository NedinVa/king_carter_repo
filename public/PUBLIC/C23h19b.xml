<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Edward Tucker, August 19, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, August 19, 1723, that he sends a bill of lading (not present) for 10 hogsheads of  leaf tobacco on board Captain Wilson's ship. He notes that recent bad weather has greatly damaged the crops,  and that he owes the merchant some tobacco for which there was no room the previous year or this year. Gloucester beer and Southam cider is ordered, and he requests that Tucker allow Captain Giles Russell to taste it on his behalf.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<note id="n3">[3] Francis Chamberlayne  (abt. 1667-1728) was from a  Warwickshire family. His father was also a London merchant, and "Chamberlayne engaged in commerce himself and may have been involved in the slave trade." He was quite wealthy, and represented New Shoreham in Parliament at two different times, first as a Whig, and later as a Tory.

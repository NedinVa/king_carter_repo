<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John King, 1720 July 13</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Bristol merchant John King, July 13,
1720, chiefly concerning 120 hogsheads of tobacco that a ship's
captain had planned to deliver to his owners rather than to the
mechant to whom Carter had directed them; that merchant had died.
Carter plans to take action in Virginia against the captain. He adds
that he hopes to ship some tobacco to King on Captain Stratton's
ship, and that he has drawn a bill of exchange on King to Joseph
Belfield.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony 
 have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>

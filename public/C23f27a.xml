</head>
<p>Letter from Robert Carter to London merchant Thomas Colmore, June 27, 1723, to cover a shipment of 20 hogsheads of tobacco on board the <hi rend="italics">Booth</hi> commanded by Captain Wills. He asserts that it was grown and carefully handled on his home plantations, is good as any produced on York River, and will, he hopes, fetch a good price. He had intended 50 hogsheads for Captain Wills, but his sloop called for them while Carter was in Williamsburg, and without orders, the tobacco was not loaded.</p>

<p>Robert Carter writes to chide Samuel Smith of King and Queen County, January 22, 1728, for not making the required legal arrangements for Smith's brigantine, the <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> to unload its cargo of rum and take on tobacco for its voyage back to England. Carter notes he is willing to post the required bond provided Smith will sign a counter bond to indemnify Carter.</p>

Carter review the clerk's draft of this letter and added an occasional word in his hand as is indicated by the use of bold italics.</note>

<note>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Samuel Smith was a resident of King and Queen County where he was a justice, and would be sheriff in 1730 and 1731.(<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:215, 235. </bibl></cit>) </note>

<note id="n2">[2] The <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> was a ship owned by King and Queen County resident Samuel Smith; she was commanded by Thomas Price. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C28a22a.html">Carter to Samuel Smith</xref>, January 22, 1728.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3]  Robert Carter's home, "Corotoman," was located on the northeastern bank of the Rapphannock River in Lancaster County close to the present-day community of Weems.  A stream called Corrotoman [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>] River ran inland west of the house. Carter built a fine house there in the mid 1720s, but it burned in January 1729. See the <xref to="http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/corotoman.html">"Corotoman" page</xref> of the web site of Historic Christ Church Foundation for more information about the house and excavation of its ruins.  ( See the <hi rend="italics">Maryland Gazette</hi> for February 4-11, 1728/29 for comment on Carter's loss. The Maryland Archives has placed its copies of the  <hi rend="italics">Maryland Gazette</hi> online. Unfortunately, page four of the issue of February 4-11, 1728/29 is missing, and that must be where the notice of the fire at Corotoman appeared; the text is quoted in secondary sources as reading: "The fine large house of Colonel Carter on the Rappahannock was also burnt lately. The particulars of his loss we can't give you, but we are inform'd it is very great." [<hi rend="italics">Garden Club of Virginia Journal</hi>, May-June 1983, p.8.])</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Brthen means "bearing a small or comparatively small load. Of a vessel: Having a small burthen, or (the usual sense) unladen, without cargo."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

 <note id="n6">[6] The naval officer was an official in the colony that reported to the Commissioners of Customs, a body that had first been established in 1663; the group was reorganized several times, especially after 1688. The board was "intrusted with collection of customs both in England and the colonies." The board helped write many of the instructions for colonial governors in collaboration with the Privy Council. "Their direct connection with the colonies was through the governors, who were instructed to correspond with the commissioners, and to send them, every three months, lists of clearances, and also reports of illegal trading. The governor's agent in matters of trade was the naval officer whom he was empowered to appoint, but who was required by the 7th and 8th William III to give security to the commissioners of customs."

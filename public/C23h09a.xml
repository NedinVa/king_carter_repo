<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Mrs. Mary Colston, August 9, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter responds to a letter from Mrs. Mary Colston, August 9, 1723, concerning her desire to take out a patent on waste and surplus lands in and adjacent to lands originally  patented to James Williamson in Richmond County. He explains that waste and surplus lands are patented in different ways, and that he believes that Williamson's orphans should have first chance to patent any surplus in their father's land. He suggests Mrs. Colston consult Colonel Charles Barber as to her claims so that Barber may satisfy Carter about them.</p>

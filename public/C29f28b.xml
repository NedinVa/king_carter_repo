<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, June 28, 1729</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, June 28, 1729, to report shipments of tobacco from himself and the Burwell estate on the <hi rend="italics">Bailey,</hi> and to inform the merchant that he remains interested in holding a share in a new vessel in the Virginia tobacco trade. He informs Dawkins of a number of bills of exchange, the conclusion of "your Affair with Mr. Lee," his approval of "your Chastizements of my son Robert" for his sloppy business practices, and that he has received "the Widdow Hutchins's Obligation for your Debt."</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The <hi rend="italics">Bailey</hi> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. (<cit><bibl>Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</bibl></cit> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter sent letters by Captain Naylor in the fall of 1728, but apparently the ship was lost on its way to Liverpool because Carter noted to William Dawkins 1728 June 29, the ship "<sic corr="has">hath</sic> never been heard of."</note>

<note id="n3">[3] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11. <cit><bibl><title>Virginia Tax Records.</title> [Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, Inc., 1983.] p. 539.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] "Thos. Edwards, a little petty Fogging Lawyer the Clark of our
County that hath as much Mettle and more cunning for Contention then his predecessor had" Carter wrote
to Landon Jones, July 22, 1723. His opinion of Edwards later changed for there are more appreciative mentions of him in Carter's diary. Edwards was clerk of the Lancaster County court from 1720-1746.

<note id="n5">[5] Isham Randolph was captain of the London ship  <hi rend="italics">Williamsburgh</hi> in 1725-26, and Charles Rogers commanded her in 1727-29. She was a large vessel of 550 tons and carried a crew of 26 men.

<note id="n7">[7] Carteer refers to the old proverb "sue a beggar and catch a louse."</note>

<note id="n8">[8] Hancock Lee (1653-1709) was an intimate friend of Robert Carter who was named in Lee's will as "a good friend," and appointed one of the trustees of his children. (<cit><bibl n="B11">Lee. <title>Lee Chronicle . . .</title> pp. 33-35.</bibl></cit>)</note>

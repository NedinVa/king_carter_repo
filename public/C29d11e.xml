<title>Letter from Robert Carter to the Freighters of the Ship Rose, April 11 and June 26, 1729</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the "freighters of the Ship Rose," April 11, 1729, to report on his concluding the financial affairs that grew out of his management of the sale of the <hi rend="italics">Rose's</hi> cargo of slaves, and that he is sending tobacco to them on board the <hi rend="italics">Rappahannock</hi>. In a post script on June 26, he sends a bill of lading (not present) on the <hi rend="italics">William and James</hi> for more tobacco, 22 hogsheads of which are on the account of the sales of the slaves and which will nearly conclude the balancing of accounts.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond.  The clerk  began addressig this letter to "Mr John" thinking that it was to be sent to John Pemberton, but he was corrected and struck these words through which the software will not allow to be shown as deleted <hi rend="italics">in situ</hi>. The letter seems to break off at the end of the first page, but it is damaged at that point and the editor cannot be certain.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] James Christian was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Rose,</hi> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </note>

<note id="n2">[2] There  were several vessels with the name <hi rend="italics">Rappahannock</hi>.  One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726 and 1727. Carter's letters mention a Captain Hugh Brackhill in 1728-1729, and Captain Loxum in 1733. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship owned by merchant John Pemberton; she often carryied slaves into the colony. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain John Hyde and Company, August 1, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the London firm known as Captain John Hyde and Company, August 1, 1723, reporting the arrival of a letter the firm had sent by Captain Hopkins, complains mildly about the low prices his tobacco has brought, and more strongly about the firm's warehousing and "watching" charges. He has copies of the new act of Parliament concerning the importation of tobacco, and notes that it will mean good prices for the tobacco that is now heading for market even though there are long-term disadvantages for the colonial planters.</p>

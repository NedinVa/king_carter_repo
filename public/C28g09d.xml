<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Gale, July 9, 1728</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Gale, July 9, 1728, to inform the  merchant that he was pleased with the sales of his tobacco, but as Gale has written that the market there is not good and no opportunities for shipping available, he will not send more. He reports bills of exchange.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note>The second post script was written in around the return address and salutation at the top of the page.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Gale (<hi rend="italics">ante</hi> 1671-1729) was a Whithaven merchant whom Carter would write a number of times times between1720 and 1729. "Like his brothers John was engaged in maritime trade. Operating as John Gale and Company, he was named as the owner of the vessel <hi rend="italics">Clotilda,</hi> built in England in 1726 and registered in Whitehaven in 1727 at 25 tons." The Gale family had many connections with the colonies, especially in Virginia and Maryland. <cit><bibl>(Gayle N.Mandell, <xref to="http://gale-gaylefamilies.com/john-gayle-the-elder-whitehaven-cumberland.html">"The Gale/Gayle Families,"</xref> extensive genealogical and historical notes available online.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Gale was located in "Whitehaven [which] is a small town and port on the coast of Cumbria, England. Historically a part of Cumberland, it lies equidistant between Cumbria's two largest settlements, Carlisle and Barrow-in-Furness. . . ." (<xref to="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehaven">"Whitehaven"</xref> in Wikipedia.)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<note id="n3"> [3] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pratt, August 8, 1728</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his old and dear friend London merchant John Pratt, August 8, 1728, to complain mildly about the arragements mechant John Falconar has made in the purchase of silver plate for his daughter, Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell Nicholas. He asks Pratt to have him sent Bristol water as he understands it is good for a "cheerfull clear Temper." Affectionate greetings to another friend and to Pratt conclude the letter.</p>

<note id="n2">[2] John Falconar (d. <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27g24d.html">Carter's letter to Falconar </xref> of July 24 and August 22, 1727, for details about the payment of &pound;200 to him.

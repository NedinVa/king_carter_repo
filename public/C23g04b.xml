<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas Evans, July 4, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, July 4, 1723, an old acquaintance, to acknowledge receipt of goods and to complain strongly that Evans has not sent him accounts of the sales of his tobacco in three years. He sends an invoice for goods, and chides Evans for becoming too involved with merchant William Dawkins who has been feuding with another merchant. He adds in a post script his further complaint about Evans' treatment of him.

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1723 July 4 -1724 June 11, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. This draft is the first one in the letter book, and the paper has darkened from exposure to light and from wear; there are some small holes at the foot of the page that obscure some words. The editor thanks E. Lee Shepard of the Society for his assistance in attempting to establish the text at the foot of this page.</note><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and state have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note><lb/>

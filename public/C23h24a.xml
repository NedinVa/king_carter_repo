<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain Thomas Hooper, August 24, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Captain Thomas Hooper, August 24, 1723, concerning the tobacco that arrived on board Carter's sloop, complaining that the shipment was small and that Thomas Carter has not sent him the information he needs about what quantities are his son's or were from Colonel Mason. He then as a friend chides Hooper for drinking too much and not spending enough time on his responsibilities to Carter. Instructions regarding the granting of lands follow, including a specific order that he will  make no grants in or near the Brent Town grant, and that Hooper should not do any work there at all. Carter comments on the high fees that the Stafford vestry clerk charges for copying out the levy lists, and returns to chiding Hooper by noting that he finds it "Something Extraordinary" that Hooper should press Carter for Thomas Lee's note on Hooper for payment of the quit rents. In conclusion he adds some details of business and again urges Hooper to pay attention to his business. </p>

<salute>Sir</salute>

<p>I have received your <sic corr="several">severall</sic><lb/>
letters and congratulate you on your<lb/>
NavaL Office place. <note n="EA">Mr <sic corr="Athawes">Athaws</sic></note><lb/>
and I have given security for you<lb/>
here at our <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add> and hope you<lb/>
will take care that there shall never<lb/>
be any mistake or error.</p>

<p>I also desire you will be very <lb/>
punctual and exact in doing all<lb/>
your business as a Merchant to be<lb/>
sure to endorse all your bills<lb/>
regular and to  give advice to what<lb/>
Account they are to be placed; for<lb/>
I shall keep your Naval Office<lb/>
Account distinct; and to advise<lb/>
whenever you draw any bills:<lb/>
for I will pay no bills without<lb/>
advice <abbr expan="although">altho'</abbr> I believe it may be

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
your hand. Also, draw your bills <lb/>
at sixty days, which gives time to <lb/>
be in cash if it should be otherwise. <lb/>
I desire you will write to me often. <lb/>
Your place gives you great opportu=<lb/>
nity of conveyance.</p>

	<p>As to the Tobacco Trade, it continues<lb/>
 bad&mdash;the price low. Notwithstand<lb/>
-ing the advices we have of the dam<lb/>
-age the great rains have done to the last <lb/>
crop in Virginia, our buyers <lb/>
will not believe any thing until <lb/>
they <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add> a real security, which is <lb/>
far from with us at present.</p>

<p>As to your Copper mine, it is <lb/>
likely to be a very good thing; but <lb/>
Mr <sic corr="Athawes,">Athaws,</sic> who has taken a great <lb/>
deal of pains in having it proved by <lb/>
the greatest artist, will give you a <lb/>
full account of what <add resp="editor">[omission in text]</add> he knows <lb/>
of it.</p>

<p>	As I have had some small share in your <lb/>
education, so I <abbr expan="cannot">can't</abbr> forbear giving you advice <lb/>
and recommending to you strict virtue and <lb/>
integrity in every action of your life.</p>

<p>You know <note target="n1">Mr. Heath</note> has a <lb/>
Country Seat. If you meet with <lb/>
any rarity of trees of plants, it <lb/>
will be an acceptable present; <lb/>
which is all I shall trouble you <lb/>
with at present, but assure you <lb/>
I am

These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's&mdash;now lost&mdash; and some incoming letters, from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections" obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained.</note><lb/>

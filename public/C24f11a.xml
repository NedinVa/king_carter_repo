<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, June 11, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 11, 1724, to enclose a bill  of lading for 22 hogsheads of leaf tobacco on board the <hi rend="italics">Vine,</hi> and commenting on the diminishing trade in the colony from the non-London ships. He adds that Scots merchants have taken much tobacco, and that the current crop will be poor in part because of the limit on plants that each man is allowed. He reports a number of bills of exchange, and alerts Pemberton that he will soon send an invoice for goods. He closes with a complaint that the slave shoes the merchant has sent are too  small.</p>

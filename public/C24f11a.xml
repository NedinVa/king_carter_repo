<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, June 11, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 11, 1724, to enclose a bill  of lading for 22 hogsheads of leaf tobacco on board the <hi rend="italics">Vine,</hi> and commenting on the diminishing trade in the colony from the non-London ships. He adds that Scots merchants have taken much tobacco, and that the current crop will be poor in part because of the limit on plants that each man is allowed. He reports a number of bills of exchange, and alerts Pemberton that he will soon send an invoice for goods. He closes with a complaint that the slave shoes the merchant has sent are too  small.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The <hi rend="italics">Vine</hi> at this time was commanded by a Captain Watkinson. The vessel seems to have belonged to Micajah Perry. (See Carter to Pemberton  March 25, 1724.) </note>

<note id="n3">[3] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph would be sent to England in 1729 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission would be successful.

<note id="n4">[4] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.  (<cit><bibl n="B22">Price. <title>Perry of London. . . . </title> pp. 64-65.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5"> [5] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry, May 12, 1732</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant  Alderman [Micajah] Perry,May 12, 1732, to report the arrival of a number of letters and accounts by several ships concerning his own and the affairs of the Burwell and Page estates. He asks the merchant to consider a discount  on some transactions, and is pleased to  have the final deeds for the purchase of the Lloyd estate although there may problems obtaining acceptance in the colonial courts whose standards are different from those in England. The charges of the British lawyer who handled the Lloyd transaction are far greater than he had expected but must be paid. Comments about local matters including payment of debts such as those of Dr. George Nicholas and tobacco shipments follow. He thanks Perry for writing that his grandson, Lewis Burwell, has survived the small pox and for nice comments about Burwell, but adds that it would have been nice if Burwell had bothered to write to his mother and grandfather. </p>

it does not Come up to the proof our Law requires of living witnesses and <lb/>
how that is to be had in this case I can't tell unless the duplicates Mr.<lb/>

which I suppose Mr. Snell will take Care to send me which our lawyers <lb/>
Say they think will Cure all defects Mr. Snells bill of Charges is <lb/>
an Afterclap I never dreamt of I am altogether unfit to say whether <lb/>
it be right or no it is a very large bill the affair has been a long time <lb/>
upon the Anvil if I remember right in some of my <abbr expan="Accounts Current">Accots Currt.</abbr> I <lb/>

for my assistance I had <sic corr="disposed">disposd</sic> of all my <abbr expan="tobacco">tobo</abbr> and all within my power <lb/>
before I knew anything of him. The <note target="7">quit rents</note> I expect little or nothing <lb/>
from by the Obstinacy of the people against the Law if I succeed better <lb/>
than my present expectations it may be I may do a little for him <lb/>
but to send any of that tobacco to London is next to giving it away and in= <lb/>

of my strength is shared among <abbr expan="Your">Yr.</abbr> Ships I have sent a great deal of <abbr expan="tobacco">tobo</abbr> <lb/>
to the Outports which affords somewhat better <sic corr="prices">prizes</sic> than we get from <lb/>

power when I see him if you will have patience and he agrees to it <lb/>
I <sic corr="believe">beleive</sic> you may be in no danger of <abbr expan="Your">Yr.</abbr> money in the long run, I am <lb/>
very sorry he <sic corr="has">hath</sic> been so indiscreet to <note target="n12">plunge</note> himself at this egregious <lb/>
rate I <sic corr="believe">beleive</sic> one great means <sic corr="has">hath</sic> been from his being <abbr expan="Concerned">Concern'd</abbr> in <del>an</del> <lb/>
an Iron Work which they say now promises Wonders and that they have <lb/>
already run iron enough to reimburse all their Charges</p>

<p>We have been so pressd for some Country debts due from Colonel <lb/>
<sic corr="Page's">pages</sic>  Estate that we have been <abbr expan="forced">forc'd</abbr> to take up Cash to discharge <lb/>
them and we have been <abbr expan="under">undr.</abbr> the necessity of drawing upon You <note target="n13">bills <lb/>

tobacco that is on board the <sic corr="Rebecca">Rebeccah</sic> was inspected under the view of Several <lb/>
Gentlemen who give it a very extraordinary Character it was made at <lb/>
his best plantations Indeed I saw some of it myself and am in great hopes <lb/>
you will be able to advance it to the top market </p>

<pb n="4"/><lb/><lb/>
<p>I have already <sic corr="advised">advisd</sic> you <note target="n14">Mr. Falconars</note> Executors have <lb/>
taken a short way to pay themselves Colonel Pages debt to their Testator <lb/>
by Stopping money that was owing to me from Falconars Estate which <lb/>
I well know they cannot legally do but I am almost come to the humour, <lb/>
of resting tamely under it and waiting till I can be <sic corr="reimbursed">reimburst</sic> from the <lb/>
Estate We hope to <del>go a great way</del> discharge <note n="ET">Mr. Tuckers</note> debt <add place="supralinear">this year by some <abbr expan="tobacco">tobo</abbr> sent him</add> <note n="WD">Mr. <lb/>
Dawkins</note> will not have much to Claim Mr. Bradbys we hope to lessen <lb/>
considerably if he sells the <abbr expan="tobacco">tobo</abbr> for any thing that is to account for <note target="n15">Mr. <lb/>
Lydes</note> debt will be very much <abbr expan="reduced">reduc'd</abbr> and then we shall in a manner <lb/>
be altogether in <abbr expan="Your">Yr.</abbr> hands but there we must Expect a Considerable increase</p>

<p>As you have very generously professd a tender regard &amp; <lb/>
friendship both to <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Page and his <note target="n16">remains</note> and that You will stick at <lb/>
nothing to serve this Estate in helping it <add place="supralinear">out</add> of its present <note target="n17">Thraldom</note> so it must <lb/>
be our part to take Care that you have all proper Justice from us in return. <lb/>
It is now more nearly my Concern than it was before the death of the poor young <lb/>
Gentleman that was so suddenly <sic corr="snatched">snatcht</sic> away and I shall more nearly consider all <lb/>
the ways in my power to extricate it out of its present distress </p>

<p>Your broken account against Mr. Burwell's Estate and me too <lb/>
<abbr expan="although">altho'</abbr> but for one hogshead of tobacco of my own strikes very deep what the loss is to <lb/>
be does not yet Appear indeed your <sic corr="accounts">accots</sic> of your sales to this Date are very <lb/>
recent but the Sales of some tobacco I had made to<note target="n18"> Alderman Levett</note> is much of another <lb/>
Stamp by a Certain Gentleman I am <abbr expan="Charged">Charg'd</abbr> with a loss for some <sic corr="tobacco">tobaccoe</sic> sold in the <lb/>
years 1724:25:26 after several accounts <sic corr="Current">Currant</sic> <abbr expan="received">receiv'd</abbr> this matter I <lb/>
must never Submit to unless the law will Condemn me to it but more of this <lb/>
hereafter</p>

<p>It is very comfortable news to hear that my Grandson <note target="n19">Lewis <lb/>
Burwell</note> was recovered out of that fatal distemper to Virginians the Small <lb/>
pox and the good <add place="supralinear">things</add> you <add place="supralinear">are <sic corr="pleased">pleasd</sic> to</add> say of him in respect to his morals and improvements <lb/>
are no less pleasing If out <add place="supralinear">of</add> your great respects to him and his father you have <lb/>
not been too indulgent to his Character <sic corr="methinks">my thinks</sic> it had been but a dutiful <abbr expan="piece">ps.</abbr> <lb/>
of Respect if not to me at least to his mother to have afforded a line under his 

<pb n="5"/><lb/><lb/>
hand but he takes no more notice of either of us than if he had no such relations <lb/>
This letter is got to a great length and yet I shall add one paragraph more</p>

<p>I will not set up to foretell what will be the fate of the Shipping <lb/>
this year the general <sic corr="Cry">Crye</sic> at <sic corr="Williamsburg">Williamsburgh</sic> was that the Crops were very <lb/>
Short in most parts of the Country and that many of the Ships of which we <lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The <hi rend="italics">Bailey</hi> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove 1730-1732.

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Spotswood</hi> was a  London ship commanded by James Bradby,  1727-1732, and was owned by Micajah Perry.

<note id="n4">[4] Carter held a lease to the Lloyd estate, which was that of John Lloyd, husband of his niece Elizabeth, for many years. He noted in a <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C23g13a.html">letter to Micajah Perry</xref> July 13, 1723, that the estate consisted of about 1,900 acres. These holdings apparently lay up the Rappahannock near the falls as Carter always  sent his sloop for its tobacco.  The estate's tobacco mark was the double arrowhead or double "L" which Carter frequently uses in his
diary and letters to refer to it. He undertook to buy the Lloyd estate in the later years of his life, and finally acquired it about 1732. (<hi rend="italics">Revised 2007 Nov. 30</hi>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."  (<xref to="http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Governor_s_Council_The">"The Governor's Council"</xref> in <title>Encyclopedia Virginia</title>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6]  Charles Seabrook was a partner with Thomas Reynolds in a Yorktown business. In Seabrook's 1752 will, he bequeathed half his estate to Reynolds including his share in a sloop. (<cit><bibl>"Reynolds and Rogers." <title>William and Mary College Quarterly Historical Magazine</title>,12: 128;</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl>Survey Report 04620 summarizing the 1743 will of George Tilly in Principal Probated Registry Class Will-Register Books 26 BOYCOTT Probate Act Book 1743, f. 9, vo, mentions Chas. Seabrook as a witness together with the chief and second mates and the ship's carpenter.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n7">[7] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n8">[8] Out port means "a port outside a particular place; any port other than the main port of a country, etc.; spec[ically]. a British port other than London."   (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online </title></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n9">[9] The <hi rend="italics">Rebecca </hi> was probably a London ship; she was of 300 tons, had a crew of 11, and was commanded by Samuel Malbon in 1730-32. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 06445 sumarizing "Adm. 68/196," "Greenwich Hospital: General Accounts. the Names of Ships and The Accounts Paid for Sixpences at the Port of London."</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n10">[10] The <hi rend="italics">Micajah &amp; Philip</hi> was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal."

<note id="n11">[11] Carter may refer to Samuel Haswell, a London Assurance director in Suffolk Lane, and a member of Haswell and Brooks which was a London firm listed in 1740 directories of that city.

<note id="n12">[12] Carter uses the word "plunge" in the sense of "the point at which a person is precipitated into trouble, difficulty, or danger; a critical situation, a strait; a dilemma."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>) </note>

<note id="n13"> [13] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n14">[14] John Falconar (1677-1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. He apparently was in  New Jersey and Maryland, 1699-1705. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible.

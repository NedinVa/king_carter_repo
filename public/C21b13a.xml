<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, February 13, 
1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, February 13, 1721, to thank him for news of his sons studying in England, and comments on Dawkins' dismal reports "of the Stock Jobbing Trade." He then responds to Dawkins' complaints about the quality of his tobacco. He promises to let Captain Baily Kent "hear of this foolish prateling on both Sides of his Ears" for carrying false tales about a  part of Carter's tobacco production. There are outport ships in Virginia taking advantage of the larger merchants holding back their ships from an early voyage, and some colonists are rushing to obtain good freight rates. He hopes the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi> will 
arrive safely next month. </p>

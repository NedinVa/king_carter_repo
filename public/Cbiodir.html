Katherine who in turn passed it to a doctor named Thomas Weir in
1686. Weir obtained letters patent on the formula from James II in
1687. (<bibl>George B. Griffenhagen and James Harvey Young. "Old

<A name ="BT">BRENT TOWN</a> was a speculative land development put
together by Nicholas Hayward (d. <I>ante</I> 1697) of London, a
notary public, merchant, and speculator. Hayward assembled a
syndicate composed of London merchants <A HREF="Cbibl.html#RB">Robert
Bristow</A> (1643-1707)  and Richard Foote (his brother-in-law), and
George Brent of <q>Woodstock," Stafford County. The syndicate
purchased on January 10, 1686/87, from Lord Culpeper, by then the
sole owner of the Northern Neck Proprietary, 30,006 acres in Stafford
County "Between the Courses of the said Two Rivers, Rappahannock and
Potowmack  . . . upon and Between the Southwest and Northeast
Branches of Ocaquant Creek. . . ." Hayward obtained a dispensation
from King James II that would allow the Hugenots that he hoped to
settle on the land to have the "full exercise  of their Religion."
The town that Hayward hoped to build on the tract was called Brenton,
"but this was corrupted by local [Virginia] usage into Brent Town,
and that came to be the designation of the whole tract." Hayward was
not successful in persuading Hugenots to move to the lands, and,
after flirting with other possibilities, the tract remained unsettled
and unsurveyed at the time of his death about 1697. The members of
the syndicate and their heirs bequeathed and sold their rights in the
Brenton tract for generations. Robert Carter was to have considerable
trouble over the tract after becoming agent of the proprietors  again
in 1721. He was pressed to grant lands in the area of Brenton, but it
was very difficult to do so because the tract had not been
surveyed&mdash;and was not to be until 1737-1738.  Fairfax Harrison,
in a chapter entitled "Brent Town, Ravensworth and the Hugenots," in
his <cite>Landmarks of Old Prince William</cite> (from which all
quotations used here are taken) tells the story of Brent Town 
extremely well.  (<A HREF="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison. <cite>Landmarks.

<A name="BHQ">BRICK HOUSE QUARTER</name>  was located in Lancaster
County and was a "collection of parcels acquired . . . from various
owners"; in the 1732 inventory of Robert Carter's estate, there were
20 slaves, 63 sheep, 45 hogs, and 46 cattle on the place. (<cit><bibl

<A name="RB">BRISTOW, ROBERT</a>  (1643-1707), "emigrated to
Virginia about 1660 and established himself in Gloucester County." He
became 
a burgess, and supported the government during Bacon's Rebellion,
was captured by the rebels, and lost much property. He is usually
referred to as "Major Bristow," probably because of his service at
this time. Returning to England in 1677, he became a member of the
Grocer's Company, a successful merchant in the Virginia trade, and an
alderman of London. His daughter was married to <A HREF="#AB2">Arthur
Bailey</a>. Bristow was one of the four partners in the <A
HREF="#BT">Brenton  land</A> speculation in Virginia; see the letter
of January 1, 1715, Hooper to Robert Carter, for more information.

power of attorney to Thomas Booth of York County for that purpose. In
1772, a Thomas Booth was still the Bristow family's agent, but their
lands were confiscated during the American Revolution. Bristow was a
Member of Parliament for Winchelsea, 1708-1737, and a director of the
Bank of England. (<A HREF="Cbibl.html#A5">Tyler. <cite>"Inscriptions

practiced that profession in Virginia where he was Attorney General
and 
Secretary of State as well as a member of the Council and holder of
many lesser offices. He succeeded Robert Carter as agent for the
proprietors of the Northern Neck in 1711, and, due to his poor
health, left the records in a considerable muddle as Robert Carter
found upon resuming the agency in 1721. Jenings accrued many debts,
especially to London merchant <A HREF="#MP">Micajah Perry</a>, and
Robert 
Carter eventually took a mortgage on Jenings' estate, "Ripon Hall,"
taking 
it over when Jenings could not make the payments. Because of poor
health Jenings was suspended from the Council in 1726 when Lt.
Governor Hugh Drysdale was planning a trip to England for his health.
Robert Carter thus became first member of the Council, and acting
governor upon Drysdale's sudden death on July 22, 1726. (<A

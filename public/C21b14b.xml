<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter refers to the scandal of the value of the
stock of the South Sea and other companies which wild speculation had
driven enormously high in June 1720, and which was nearly worthless
several months later. Many fortunes were made and lost. Perhaps the
most succesful speculator was Sir Robert Walpole who made a fortune,
retired, and then was called to save the nation as prime minister, a
post he held from 1721 until 1742. (<cit><bibl>Goldwin Smith.

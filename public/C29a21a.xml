<note id="n1">[1] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" but as  Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, the overseer Carter refers to here must have been the local one for  the specific Burwell property.

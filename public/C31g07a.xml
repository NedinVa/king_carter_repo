<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Peter How was a merchant of Whitehaven (on the Irish sea in northwest England), who, with Richard Kelsick, traded with the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area from the early 18th century. "In 1745, Peter How and Richard Kelsick built a store on the corner of Caroline and Hanover streets (Lot 16). While Kelsick continued to be based on the Northern Neck, How ran the Fredericksburg store, returning to Whitehaven sometime before 1756. The store operation evidently continued, for his ships made the annual voyage into the 1760s. The property was acquired in 1767 by James Ritchie &amp; Co. of Glasgow; but How was back in Spotsylvania in the 1770s pursuing debtors." "He had interests in coal and iron-ore mines and set up an iron-working forge at Low Mill in 1750. Debts incurred by the forge and the decline in the tobacco trade may have contributed to his bankruptcy in 1763."  (<cit><bibl>Paula S. Felder. "Fredericksburg and Whitehaven Connection to English Port a Forgotten Chapter in Area's Colonial History Living-history Program," Fredericksburg<hi rend="italics"> Free-Lance Star</hi>, 7/2/2005,</bibl></cit> and Notes on a portrait of  "<xref to="http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/2188/mrs-peter-how-and-her-two-children-peter-and-christian-james-the-elder-cranke">Mrs Peter How</xref> and her Two Children, Peter and Christian,"  10/16/2015 )</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter noted in his diary January 19,  1727, the arrival of the <hi  rend="italics">Mazareen</hi> at his house and a visit from her captain, Richard Kelsick, four days earlier.  Kelsick, with Peter How, a merchant of Whitehaven (on the Irish sea in northwest England), traded with the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area from the early 18th century. See footnote 1.

<note id="n3"> [3] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Peter Leheup, June 28, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Peter Leheup, the colony's agent in England, June 28, 1727, to inform him that it appears that the copies of the minutes of the Council and the other "publick paprs:" will not reach Carter in time to be sent by the current fleet. He is sending a copy of the Council's resolution establishing the embargo in case there is discussion of it at home.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Peter Leheup, an English Treasury clerk, was Virginia's  and other colonies' agent in England for some years. He was related by marriage to the Prime Minister's brother who was secretary of the Treasury. His influence would be greater near the end of Carter's life.(<cit><bibl n="B22">Price. <title>Perry of London. . . . </title> pp. 75-77, 80, 83.</bibl></cit>)</note>

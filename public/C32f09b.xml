</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 9, 1732, to inform him of two shipments of tobacco, bills of exchange, and to enclose an invoice for goods (not present). Stories in the colony report that tobacco is in short supply and he hopes that will affect the market favorably.He requests Pemberton enquire of Samuel Hallows if it is true that he has sold an estate to Thomas Carter that he, Robert Carter, had tried previously to buy as he remains interested in it.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1"> [1] The <hi rend="italics">True Blue</hi> was commanded by Captain Berry in 1732; she may have been owned by Liverpool merchant John Pemberton. (See Carter to John Pemberton, 1732 April 12.)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter first mentions this vessel in a letter to Foster Cunliff of 1731June 24, noting that a Captain Fowler commanded her. Other mentions in letters to Cunliff and John Pemberton, both Liverpool merchants, indicate that probably was the vessel's home port.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel named the <hi rend="italics"> Loyalty</hi>in 1729-1730 and perhaps later. (Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter's letters to John Pemberton 1730 April 15 and 1731 August 4.)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] A Captain Leatherland commanded the <hi rend="italics">William &amp; James</hi> in 1729 June 20, and the <hi rend="italics">Samuel &amp; Jane</hi> in 1732. (<cit><bibl>Carter to John Pemberton, 1729 June 20,</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl>Carter to Pemberton 1732 July 13.</bibl></cit>)</note>


<note id="n5">[5] Foster Cunliffe (d. 1767) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Liverpool who worked to expand manufacturing and the capacity of the harbor; he served a number of terms as mayor.  He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. (<cit><bibl>James A. Picton, <hi rend="italics">ed.</hi> <title>Liverpool Municipal Archives and Records. . . .</title> [Liverpool, 1907.] pp. 27, 31, 79, 90, 96, etc.</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl>Paul G. Clemens. "The Rise of Liverpool, 1665-1750." <title>Economic History Review.</title> 24[May 1976]:211-225.</bibl></cit></note>


<note id="n6">[6] Samuel Hallows (Hallowes) was a great nephew of John Hallowes, an early landholder in Northumberland and later, Westmoreland County, who was usually identified as of "Nomini" in Westmoreland County. Samuel Hallows lived in Ashworth, County Lancaster, England. The tract in which Carter was interested may have been that of 2400 acres acquired from Hallowes in 1733 by Thomas Lee. ("Major John Hallowes, 1615-1657" in <cit><bibl n="B38">Norris. <title>Westmoreland County, Virginia.</title> pp. 99-102.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n7">[7] Thomas Lee (1690-1750) of Westmoreland County was the son of Richard Lee II, and nephew of Edmund Jenings; he would build "Stratford," and succeed Carter on the Council. For a good article on Thomas Lee, see  that by Jeanne A. Calhoun (<A HREF="http://www.stratfordhall.org/thomas.html?RESEARCH"></A>)  on Stratford plantation's website. (<cit><bibl>Burton J. Hendrick. <title>The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family.</title> [Boston: Little Brown, 1935]. pp. 48, 51, etc.</bibl></cit>)</note>

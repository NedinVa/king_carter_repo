</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 9, 1732, to inform him of two shipments of tobacco, bills of exchange, and to enclose an invoice for goods (not present). Stories in the colony report that tobacco is in short supply and he hopes that will affect the market favorably.He requests Pemberton enquire of Samuel Hallows if it is true that he has sold an estate to Thomas Carter that he, Robert Carter, had tried previously to buy as he remains interested in it.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note>The last two paragraphs on the second page of this draft letter are in a different hand than the text that precedes.  Apparently Carter started the draft with one clerk, and finished with another. The change in hand is indicated by a change in the color of the text.</note>

<note id="n3"> [3] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>.

<note id="n4">[4] Carter first mentions the <hi rend="italics">Mayflower</hi> in a letter to Foster Cunliff of <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C31f24a.html">June 24 1731</xref>, noting that a Captain Fowler commanded her. Other mentions in letters to Cunliff and John Pemberton, both Liverpool merchants, indicate that city probably was the vessel's home port. There were a number of vessels of this name sailing from various British ports that appear in the records of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, but two that seem pertinent are: <cit><bibl>Survey Report 06445 summarizing "Public Record Office Class: Adm. 68/196.

<note id="n7">[7] Out port means "a port outside a particular place; any port other than the main port of a country, etc.; spec[ically]. a British port other than London."   (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online </title></bibl></cit>)</note>

 <note id="n8"> [8] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n8">[9] Foster Cunliffe (d. 1767) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Liverpool who worked to expand manufacturing and the capacity of the harbor; he served a number of terms as mayor.  He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. (<cit><bibl>James A. Picton, <hi rend="italics">ed.</hi> <title>Liverpool Municipal Archives and Records. . . .</title> [Liverpool, 1907.] pp. 27, 31, 79, 90, 96, etc.</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl>Paul G. Clemens.

<note id="n10">[10] Samuel Hallows (Hallowes) was a great nephew of John Hallowes, an early landholder in Northumberland and later, Westmoreland County, who was usually identified as of "Nomini" in Westmoreland County. Samuel Hallows lived in Ashworth, County Lancaster, England. The tract in which Carter was interested may have been that of 2400 acres acquired from Hallowes in 1733 by Thomas Lee. Carter had written Hallows <xref doc="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C28f26a.html">1728 May 30</xref> that he would not buy the tract of land. ("Major John Hallowes, 1615-1657" in <cit><bibl n="B38">Norris. <title>Westmoreland County, Virginia.</title> pp. 99-102.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n11">11] Thomas Lee (1690-1750) of Westmoreland County was the son of Richard Lee II, and nephew of Edmund Jenings; he would build "Stratford," and succeed Carter on the Council.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, June 28, July 26, and August 23,1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 28, 1727, enclosing a bill of lading  for tobacco other than 17 hogsheads that should have been shipped on the <hi rend="italics">John and Betty.</hi> He tells the merchant that 5 of those hogsheads had been damaged in the collapse of a storage house, but he does not know how to ship it except to Liverpool. He tells Pemberton to charge his account with &pound;62 due Pemberton, and also for "Gales bill protested." He also sends two bills of exchange , an invoice for goods  which he wishes to have shipped by an early ship, and a bill of lading  for 30 hogsheads shipped on the <hi rend="italics">Rappahannock.</hi> He concludes by reporting that his negotiation for some of "Esqr. Hallows" land is at a standstill over the price. In a lengthy post script dated July 26th, Carter adds information about other bills of exchange, the safe arrival of Pemberton's slave ship, the <hi rend="italics">John and Betty,</hi> and Carter's handling of the sale of the slaves. In a second lengthy post script dated August 23 Carter encloses a bill of lading for tobacco  and orders that it be "sold at the Mast." He also encloses an account of the sales of slaves and 30 first bills of exchange received during the sale, noting that he is sending second bills of exchange by the <hi rend="italics">Carter.</hi> He and Captain Denton have had a dispute over Carter's role in the sale and the commission charged for his services; he writes that he had undertaken the sale as a favor to Pemberton, an old friend, and that he will deal only with the principal in such matters, not with the ship's master. None of the enclosures mentioned are present.</p>

Second post script from Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. Carter has edited this draft as is indicated by the use of italics.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Watkinson was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Vine,</hi> a ship that may have been owned by Micajah Perry. (Carter to Pemberton, 1724 March 25)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.

<note id="n4">[4] There probably were several vessels with this name. One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726/27. Carter's letters mention a Captain Brackhill in 1728, and Captain Loxum in 1733. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] The attorney general of the colony, <note n="JR">John Randolph,</note> may have represented "Esqr. Hallows."</note>

<note id="n6">[6] John Hallowes (Hallows) (1615-1657) had come to Maryland as an indentured servant, but later moved to Westmoreland County where he acquired extensive tracts of land. Some of that land was purchased in 1733 by Thomas Lee from Samuel Hallowes of County Lancaster, England, who "as a great nephew of Major John Hallowes," had acquired title in an important legal case decided in 1722. This land became part of Stratford. Carter may have hoped to acquire a tract from Samuel Hallowes to add to Nomini as John Hallowes had lived near that plantation of Carter's. ("Major John Hallowes. 1615-1657." <cit><bibl n="B38">Norris. <title>Westmoreland County, Virginia.</title></bibl></cit> pp. 99-103.)</note>

<note id="n7">[7] The 140 ton <hi rend="italics">Welcome</hi> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on 1727 May 17. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1727. (<cit><bibl>Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n8">[8] Mrs. Young was Carter's housekeeper. He had agreed  with her for one year's service in 1724 but found her satisfactory for a longer term.</note>

<note id="n9">[9] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship often carrying slaves owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The <hi rend="italics">Watkinson</hi> was a 100-ton  London ship commanded by William Whitehorn.

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<note id="n2">[2] Britain had been at war with Spain since February 1727; since Carter received newspapers regularly, these remarks are puzzling.  H. R. McIlwaine wrote in 1910, "It is true that in 1727 . . .  England was at war with Spain, but the war was one in which not much blood was shed and which was soon over." As Carter was writing in 1727, the Spanish were indeed beseiging Gibralter, but they were not successful and gave up in July.  The conflict would end in 1729 with the treaty of Seville by which Britain obtained Gibraltar. (<cit><bibl>H.R.

<note id="n3">[3] "The Windward Passage is a strait in the Caribbean Sea, between the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. The strait specifically lies between the easternmost region of Cuba and the northwest of Haiti. . . . 
It connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea, and is in the direct path of shipping between the Panama Canal and the eastern seaboard of the United States." (<xref to="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windward_Passage">"Windward Pasage"</xref> in Wikipedia, 1/14/2015)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Carter sent letters by Captain Naylor of a Liverpool ship in the fall of 1728, but apparently the ship was lost because Carter noted to William Dawkins<xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C29f28b.mod.html"> June 29, 1729</xref>, the ship "hath never been heard of."</note>

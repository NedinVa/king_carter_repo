<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Burridge, July 29, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant John Burridge, July 29, 1723, that he is shipping 32 hogsheads of tobacco to him on board the <hi rend="italics">Sarah</hi> of Weymouth. He reports several bills of exchange and then turns to the act in Parliament that will prohibit the importation of stemmed tobacco into England which he blames on the Scots. He concludes that recent wet weather has ruined crops.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to the brief heading on the draft.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1]  One of Carter's  clerks was named John Harvey, and there are notes on some of Carter's dictated  letters, "Harvey to copy," as on this one A John Harvey witnessed his will, and some of its codicils, which is logical if Harvey had written it out for Carter. However, on 1729 November 14, Carter wrote to Micajah Perry that Harvey, "whom you sent me from the Hospital," had completed his service. Carter indicated that he did not trust Harvey, and intimated that Harvey might have stolen some accounts of the Burwell estate of which he requested copies from Perry.</note><lb/>

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

<note id="n3">[3] Willoughby Allerton (1664-1724) was a prominent citizen of Westmoreland County where he was burgess, sheriff, and militia officer.  (<xref to="Ext18">Allerton Genealogical Data</xref> at

<note id="n4">[4] Parliament had indeed passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1729 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission would be successful. (<cit><bibl>Arthur Pierce Middleton. <title>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</title> [Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953], 116.</bibl></cit>)</note><lb/>

<note id="n5">[5] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.

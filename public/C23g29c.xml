<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain Benjamin Graves, July 29, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to his old friend, Captain Benjamin Graves, July 29, 1723, whose ship was anchored in one of the colony's rivers, with general news. He states that the news from England confirms the amendment to the tobacco bill in Parliament will  prohibit the importation of stemmed tobacco into England, and suggests that if English merchants could only be adept as Scots in avoiding dutys, they would maintain the trade. He adds that there is wet weather that may, should it continue, help the planters by limiting the crop. He wishes his friend health and success, and hopes he will write when he can. In a post script, he requests Graves bring him in a cauldron of coal on his next voyage.</p>

<note>It is surprising to find the return address of "Rappahannock" (for the river on which he lived) rather than "Corotoman," (the name of his home) on this letter as he generally used it on letters sent out of the colony. His county and the colony have been added for clarity to the brief heading on the draft.</note><lb/>

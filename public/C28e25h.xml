<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Edward Tucker, May 25 and July 9, 1728</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, May 25, 1728, to report the arrival of Captain Willson after a long voyage via Antigua, several bills of exchange, Captain Brett's inability to take his tobacco, and his hope that Willson will be able to carry it. The bulk of the letter is devoted to persuading Tucker, a member of the House of Commons, to support the colony's desire to repeal the act of Parliament probhibiting the importation of stemmed tobacco into England. In a post script dated July 8th, Carter notes that he plans to send 30 hogsheads of tobacco in Captain Willson's ship, reports bills of exchange, and orders beer, malt, and ale. </p>

The word "Mr." has been struck before Tucker's name in the salutation, but the software will not allow it to be shown struck through as it will in the body of the text.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] No information about Captain Willson has been located.</note>

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

 <note id="n5">[5] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."

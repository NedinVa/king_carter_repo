<title>Letter from John Carter to William Cage, September 20, 1722</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>John Carter, Robert Carter's oldest son, writes from London on his father's business to inform William Cage, September 20, 1722, that he has received from his father bills of exchange drawn by Edmund Jenings on merchant Micajah Perry. They are to pay in part some protested bills of Jenings's, in part some more of Jenings's debt, and in part of his father's rent due to Cage as trustee of Lord Fairfax, the proprietor of the Northern Neck. He wishes to have Cage discharge both his father and Micajah Perry, and to meet Cage should he come to London "purchasing my Father's Particular part of the Quit Rents."</p>

<note id="n1">[1] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</note>

</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, June 3, 1727, advising him of a bill of exchange payable to George Braxton that he has used to buy slaves because of the many he lost during the winter. He notes that he has received Stark's letter of February 20th, and hopes his shipment was not damaged in the grounding of the <hi rend="italics">Ann and Elizabeth,</hi> and adds that there was on board a small shipment for the Burwell estate. He will ship 30 hogsheads on the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi></p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Richard Kelsick was captain of the <hi rend="italics">Mazareen</hi> as noted in Carter's diary entry for 1727 January 19.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Edward Tucker, May 11, 1732</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, May 11, 1732, to report a large shipment of tobacco on the merchant's ship the <hi rend="italics">Portland,</hi> and commenting on the large number of ships then in the colony due apparently to rumors of a large tobacco crop which probably are not true. He encloses (not present) the bill of lading and notifies Tucker of bills of exchange. He writes that he did not receive a promised account current,  orders more Dorcester ale, and sadly notes the death of his son Robert on May 6, 1732.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<cit><bibl n="B27">Billings. <hi rend="italics">et al. </hi> <title>Colonial Virginia: A History. </title></bibl></cit> pp. 236-39.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."

<note id="n4"> [4] A bill of lading is "an official detailed receipt given by the master of a merchant vessel to the person consigning the goods, by which he makes himself responsible for their safe delivery to the consignee. This document, being the legal proof of ownership of the goods, is often deposited with a creditor as security for money advanced."  (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6]  By the Navigation Act of 1663 colonial governors were empowered to appoint an officer to carry out provisions of the Act, which officer "is there commonly known by the name of the naval officer." "Naval officers in British colonies in North America and the West Indies prepared shipping lists and forwarded them through the colonial governor to the Board of Trade or to the Treasury in England. The Navigation Act of 1696 established the naval officer's responsibility, to obtain detailed information regarding every ship entering and clearing in the colonial ports. The lists contain chronological entries of ships and their cargo. Information includes the date of entry or clearance, the type and name of the ship, its home port or colony, the details of the vessel's construction and registration, the name of the master and owner, the last port entered and the immediate destination, and the tonnage of the vessel "

<note id="n7"> [7] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n8">[8] "After Burton and London, Dorchester was also known for the quality of its ales. This honor seemed to have been due to the water. <title>The Complete Country Housewife</title> published in 1760 asserts, 'One of the best esteemed beers in England is that brewed in and near Dorchester. The excellence of this beer is in great measure owing to the quantity of chalk, with which that country abounds; which being impregnated with the water, produces that agreeable softness, for which this beer is so much admired.' . . . 'The author of <title>Every Man his Own Brewer</title> claimed it was not only the water but also the malt that made Dorchester beer unique. It is said to be brewed from barlies well germinated but not to the domination of pale malt and its peculiar taste proceeds from the starchiness of malt and quantities of salt and flour mixed with the wort.

<note id="n9">[9] Carter probably means that the ship's captain would have been thrown into even more trouble than he had been in getting cargo.</note>

<title>Letters from Robert Carter to John Pemberton &amp; Foster Cunliff, August 4, 1731</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton enclosing a letter to Foster Cunliff, also a merchant of that city, August 4, 1731, reminding Pemberton of two bills of exchange, and alerting him that he has sent tobacco consigned to him even though Pemberton has written he will no longer handle such sales. He notes that if Pemberton will not handle the sale, then he is to turn it over to Foster Cunliff, and he encloses a letter to Cunliff to that effect that Pemberton may use as he sees fit.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Foster Cunliffe (d. 1767) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Liverpool who worked to expand manufacturing and the capacity of the harbor; he served a number of terms as mayor.  He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. (<cit><bibl>James A.

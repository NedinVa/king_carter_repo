<title>Letters from Robert Carter to John Pemberton &amp; Foster Cunliff, August 4, 1731</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton enclosing a letter to Foster Cunliff, also a merchant of that city, August 4, 1731, reminding Pemberton of two bills of exchange, and alerting him that he has sent tobacco consigned to him even though Pemberton has written he will no longer handle such sales. He notes that if Pemberton will not handle the sale, then he is to turn it over to Foster Cunliff, and he encloses a letter to Cunliff to that effect that Pemberton may use as he sees fit.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Foster Cunliffe (d. 1767) was a merchant and prominent citizen of Liverpool who worked to expand manufacturing and the capacity of the harbor; he served a number of terms as mayor.  He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. (<cit><bibl>James A. Picton, <hi rend="italics">ed.</hi> <title>Liverpool Municipal Archives and Records. . . .</title> [Liverpool, 1907.] pp. 27, 31, 79, 90, 96, etc.</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl>Paul G. Clemens.

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Several vessels named <hi rend="italics">The Loyalty</hi> sailed to Virginia. One commanded by Francis Wallis cleared from Poole for Virginia in 1726. Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel of this name in 1729-1730 as did James Tarleton in 1731.

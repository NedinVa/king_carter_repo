<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Francis Lee, August 20, 1706</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee, August 20, 1706, that it seems that the tobacco shipped on board James Morgan's ship should fetch a good price since  "this long Stay of the Convoy hath very much raised the price of Tobo." He adds that the sons of Ralph Wormeley are expected with the next fleet and that their mother has engaged passage on Thomas Graves's ship. He reports bills of exchange drawn on Lee for impost on tobacco belonging to the Wormeley estate shipped on Benjamin Silvester's and Thomas Graves's ships.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (ca. 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother- and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.</note>


<note id="n2">[2] Thomas Graves commanded the <hi rend="italics">America</hi>, which was, according to the "1700 Convoy List,"  a London vessel of eighteen men and eighteen guns. A naval officer's return shows that she had been built at Ipswich in 1691, was 250 tons in size, and was owned by Sir Richard 
Levett, Robert Bristow, Esq., Arthur Bailey, John Cary, Micajah Perry, Thomas Lane, Anthony [. . .] Hope for Bendall and Mary Johnson.

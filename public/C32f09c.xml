<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, June 9, 1732, to report the arrival of a ship,  the <hi rend="italics">George &amp; Mary,</hi> Tucker has chartered, and the arrangements that he and George Eskridge have made concerning her. He adds comments about the small tobacco crop that will prevent many ships obtaining large cargoes, but hopes this will send the market up.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note target="n1"> [1] Survey Report 09732 summarizing "Public Record Office Class E 190/917/7. Exchequor King's Remembrancer Port Books. Weymouth. Customer 1733" shows that Isaac Bird was the master of the <hi rend="italics">George &amp; Mary. A snow was a two-masted vessel. </hi></note>

<note id="n2">[2] Indian Creek lies at the eastern tip of Lancaster County at the northern side of Fleets Bay where it is "the boundary between" Northumberland and Lancaster counties "for most of its course." and runs inland roughly northwest towards today's Kilmarnock. It probably was 6 or 7 miles from "Corotoman" by the roads of Carter's time. (<cit><bibl n="B29">Miller. <title>Place-Names . . . . </title>p. 72.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Carter means the last day of the previous month.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] John Russell commanded the <hi rend="italics">Portland,</hi> a vessel owned by Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker.  (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 09729 detailing the Weymouth Port Books</bibl></cit>; and <cit><bibl>Survey Report 09731 detailing Exchequor King's Remembrancer Port Books. Weymouth, Customer, 1730, found in theVirginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

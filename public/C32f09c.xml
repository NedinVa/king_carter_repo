<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, June 9, 1732, to report the arrival of a ship,  <hi rend="italics">George &amp; Mary,</hi> Tucker has chartered, and the arrangements that he and George Eskridge have made concerning her. He adds comments about the small tobacco crop that will prevent many ships obtaining large cargoes, but hopes this will send the market up.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Indian Creek lies at the eastern tip of Lancaster County at the northern side of Fleets Bay, and runs inland roughly northwest towards today's Kilmarnock. It probably was 6 or 7 miles from "Corotoman" by the roads of Carter's time.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter means the last day of the previous month.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] John Russell commanded the <hi rend="italics">Portland,</hi> a vessel owned by Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker.

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Pemberton, July 2[9] and August 29, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to  London merchant John Pemberton, July 2[9], 1723, following up on an earlier letter in which he had sent a bill of lading for 40 hogsheads of tobacco oon board the <hi rend="italics">Vine.</hi> He details several bills of exchange, and reports that the <hi rend="italics">Content</hi> will have to lie over for the next crop as there is none available for shipment. He states that the news from England confirms the amendment to the tobacco bill in Parliament will prohibit the importation of stemmed tobacco into England, which "compleats our ruin." In a post script dated August 29, 1723, he reports that bad weather has ruined the crops.</p>

<note>The second digit of the day of the month on which this draft was written has been obscured by an ink blot, but because the letter falls between others written on July 29th, it has been assumed to have been written on that date.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to the brief heading on the draft.</note><lb/>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, April 16, 1730</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to  London merchant William Dawkins, April 16, 1730, to report that he has received the accounts of sales of his tobacco and that the goods have arrived in good condition. He complains about the extremely low prices received for his tobacco, and comments on the small crops presently in Virginia and Maryland. Most of the letter is devoted to his business in the hands of merchant John Falconar who had died, and his instructions to Dawkins in representing Carter to Falconar's executors. He encloses a letter that Dawkins is to present to the executors.</p>

<note id="n4">[4] John Falconar (1677-1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. He apparently was in  New Jersey and Maryland, 1699-1705. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27g24d.html">Carter's letter to Falconar </xref> of July 24 and August 22, 1727, for details about the payment of &pound;200 to him.

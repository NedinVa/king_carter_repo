<p>I did myself the Honour to write to Your Lordship a Short time <lb/>
since by the <note target="n1">Rebecca </note><abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Malbon <del>[illegible]</del> <add place="supralinear">acknowledging</add> your Lordships favour <lb/>
by the same ship; &amp; am in hopes it contained the most suitable answer I was <lb/>
capable of giving in Relation to your Lordships proposals under the Circum= <lb/>
stances your affairs now stand, to which I desire your Lordship will be <lb/>
pleased to be referred. The Burgesses now assembled are making <add place="supralinear">a</add> fresh <lb/>
Attempt against your Lordship's Grant as you will see by the <sic corr="enclosed">inclosed</sic> Proceed <lb/>
ings, which I think it my Duty to hand to Your Lordship by this first Oppor= <lb/>
tunity. It is suggested that their last Petition to his Majesty was lost &amp; <lb/>
never presented. How far from the Truth this is Your Lordship best knows; but <lb/>
from what Your Lordship writes to me I must think much otherwise. They did <lb/>
indeed miscarry in the Design of Laying out a Sum of Money for the Solliciting <lb/>
their Petition: The Council disallowed it; But whether I shall be able to gain <lb/>
the same point now is a great Question. Our revenue-Gentlemen <del>are among</del>  <add place="supralinear">I take to be much at the Bottom</add> <lb/>

ume in Hopes of Raising the Benefit of their Places upon  <del>[illegible]</del> resuming <lb/>
it into the Hands of the Crown. This I take in a Great Measure to be the Main <lb/>
Source of all this Stir: for sure I am the Tenants in the Northern Neck are <lb/>
under as easy Circumstances in Respect to their Rents <del>as any of the</del> <lb/>
<del>King's Subjects</del>, &amp; I may say have been used with a Great deal more Lenity <add place="supralinear">than any other of the King's subjects</add><lb/>
To my very Great Loss in the Business. I <abbr expan="cannot">can't</abbr> doubt but Your Lordship's interest <lb/>

There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The <hi rend="italics">Rebecca </hi> was probably a London ship; she was of 300 tons, had a crew of 11, and was commanded by Samuel Malbon in 1731-32.

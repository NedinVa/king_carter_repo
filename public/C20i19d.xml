<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, September 19,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, September
19, 1720, sending condolences on the loss of his son and partner,
Richard. He then comments on a good sales report for some of his
tobacco, expressing hope that the remainder will sell as well. He
reports the very good and plentiful crop of tobacco in the colony
and urges Perry
to have Captain Bagwell return as soon as possible
because the crop will be ready early. He tells Perry that he has sent
copies of Perry's letters concerning Richard Foote's business to
Foote, and notes that his son John promises more economy in his
living in England which, Carter writes, will be necessary because a
good crop will lower prices. He concludes that there are no political
events of note worth reporting other than the recent campaign for
members of the Virginia legislature.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for
clarity.</note><lb/>
<note>Carter's clerk, having addressed many letters to Micajah and
Richard Perry, automatically wrote "Messrs. Perry" into the letter
book when Carter began dictating.</note><lb/>

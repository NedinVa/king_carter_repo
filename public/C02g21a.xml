<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Jonathan Mathews and John Goodwin, 1702 July 21</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter responds to a letter from the London merchants, Jonathan Mathews and John Goodwin, noting that the sales of the Wormeley estate tobacco were acceptable, and that he is sending 11 hogsheads more of good tobacco. He encloses an invoice for goods for the Wormeley family including some items not strictly necessary, arguing that the estate should assist in paying for the widow's expenses. He states that one-fifth of the previous year's tobacco belongs to his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Wormeley, the widow, who will ship her share to Mathews and Goodwin herself in the future.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The <name type="ship"><hi rend="italics">Gloster</hi></name> was built in Hampshire, England, in 1680, and was 300 tons in size; her owners were <name type="person">Charles Morgan</name> and <name type="person">Thomas Perry</name> of London. She carried 23 men and 12 guns in 1700. (<cit><bibl n="M8">Collector's return for Rappahannock River, 1701 December 25-1702 March 25, CO5/1441. . . .</bibl></cit>; and <cit><bibl n="A19">Middleton. "The Chesapeake Convoy System, 1662-1763."</bibl></cit>>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The clerk struck the word "use" that follows "familys" but it is necessary for the meaning of the sentence.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The word "familys" has been struck by the clerk and "servts." substituted. Apparently
the children's estate could support the sevants, but not the widow who was, of course, provided for by
her husband.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] What this contraction stood for cannot be determined. The meaning seems to be "of it."</note>

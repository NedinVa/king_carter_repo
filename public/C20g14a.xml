<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, July 14,
1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 14,
1720, about his pleasure at the good reports on his sons' progress at
school in England and that he is determined that they should be
raised in the Church of England. He expresses shock at the cost of
their education and that he thinks that he may move them out of the
city to a good but less expensive school, and comments on how little
his education had cost his brother during the six years he spent in
England. He notes what the colonists have learned about the "South
Sea Stock," about Captain Baily Kent's loading of his ship, and
presses Dawkins to find employment for the sons of Captain Adam
Graves. His "Controversy" [law suit] with [Thomas] Wise has nearly
concluded, he has little interest in the "bank" observations Dawkins
has sent, and adds some comments on the estate of "old Hammerton" as
Pinchback Hammerton is going to England to deal with the estate's
problems. Dawkins' debtors in the colony have sent tobacco to him
this year, but Mark Atkins has recently died with no estate of value.
He concludes that he has become a "Great Smoaker," asks Dawkins to
send him yearly a small box of tobacco, and requests his sister-in-
law, Mary Swan's, small debts to Dawkins be paid from his account.</p>

Carter's seventh child by his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis.
Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three
times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall"
today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful
diary. A reproduction of a portrait of him may be found on the

<note id="n2">[2] Although RC's clerk wrote "compote" RC probably
dictated "compute" as the word was in use by 1720. Louis Wright
incorrectly transcribed the word as "comport." </note>

<note id="n3">[3] Carter refers to the scandal of
the value of the stock of the South Sea and other companies which
wild speculation had driven enormously high in June 1720, and which
was nearly worthless several months later. Many fortunes were made
and lost. Perhaps the most succesful speculator was Sir Robert
Walpole who made a fortune, retired, and then was called to save the
nation as prime minister, a post he held from 1721 until 1742.

"traded with each other in tobacco and bills of exchange between 1707

were protested." Carter sued Wise in England to recover his money,
and he won &pound;180. (<cit><bibl>Survey Report 10147 describing

<p>I <sic corr="received">receiv'd</sic> a letter from <note n="MP2">Alderman Perry</note> of <abbr expan="December">Dec:</abbr> date acqua=<lb/>
inting me that your Lordship <sic corr="had">hath</sic> been with him to let him know how you should<lb/>
want your rent which now <sic corr="entirely">intirely</sic> belongs to yourself <note n="WC"><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Cages</note> time being expired<lb/>
In the month after and that he should accordingly pay it and he further tells me<lb/>
your lordship wanted to know whether I should be willing to <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr>ing <corr resp="editor">[the]</corr> <sic corr="lease">leas</sic> after the<lb/>
old one was Expired In answer I Acquainted him the <sic corr="lease">leas</sic> would be out in <abbr expan="September">Sep</abbr> 1731<lb/>
that I was grown old and infirm and that we were fallen into such wretched times<lb/>
by the Poor Price of <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr> in which your Lordships rents are always Paid when that<lb/>
Commodity is worth little that I did not know what to say to it However in regard I had<lb/>
so long <sic corr="through">thro</sic> so great a Part of my life <sic corr="served">servd</sic> in your Affairs both in your Ancestors<lb/>
and in your Own time I adventured to give him instructions to take a new <sic corr="lease">leas</sic> out from<lb/>
<abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> Lordship and that so soon as your lordship shall <sic corr="please">pleas</sic> to Transact it of this<lb/>
I suppose you have been Acquainted by this time</p>

<p>I also told him it was some questions with me whether it would<lb/>
be Proper for me to have a new Power from <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> lordship only and whether it is <lb/>
necessary I alter the <sic corr="style">stile</sic> of the grants of your lands for Hitherto I have gran<lb/>
ted them in the names of your Lordship and <note n="WC"><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Cage</note> as devisee in trust of my<lb/>
<note target="n1">lady Fairfax's</note> Will that it was my thoughts however not withstanding your<lb/>
Lordship had the <sic corr="Entire">Intire</sic> right to the profits of the Estate yet the trust in <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr><lb/>
Cage is still subscribing and that the Grant should go on In the same <sic corr="style">stile</sic> but in<lb/>
this I must submit to better judgements</p>

<p>I also Acquainted Alderman Perry that upon the Crowns<lb/>
having granted several <sic corr="Patents">Pattents</sic> for land According to the best information<lb/>
I can get within the Plain boundaries of the Grant and Several more <sic corr="Patents">Pattents</sic><lb/>
are daily labouring after I had Entered a <note target="n2">Caveat</note> against the Passing any<lb/>
more <sic corr="Patents">Pattents</sic> within these bounds desiring Mr. Alderman to give your Lordship<lb/>
a full Accot of this matter as I doubt not he <sic corr="has">hath</sic> already or will soon do</p>

<p>Since which we have had a hearing before the <note n="WG"><abbr expan="Governor">Govr</abbr></note> &amp;<lb/>
<note target="n3">Council</note> and here with I send <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> Lordship <sic corr="copies">copys</sic> of all the Papers relating thereto<lb/>

some of this Papers forks above the Present Inhabitants the Southern b<corr resp="editor">[ranch]</corr><lb/>

Even Above branches that issue out of Cohonkocut as above <sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> No<corr resp="editor">[w if]</corr><lb/>
Cohonkocut is the Southern boundary to the Maryland grant why it should <lb/>
be Also the Northern boundary to your Lordships grand is beyond my ca<corr resp="editor">[paci]</corr><lb/>
ty to find an Argument for And yet our <note n="JG2"><note target="n5"><sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General</note></note> declares it as hi<corr resp="editor">[s]</corr><lb/>
Opinion that the lands above <sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> are clearly the Kings and <corr resp="editor">[ . . . ]</corr><lb/>
to be granted as such and that my laying Claim in your lordships behalf <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr><lb/>
these lands that are clearly within the Express words of your grant is such<lb/>
presumption that will Endanger the grant itself Nay I have been willing<lb/>
that the <sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General should say At this Governours table after the che<corr resp="editor">[ck]</corr><lb/>
of this Caveat that he <abbr expan="believed">beleiv'd</abbr> the <note target="n6">Proprietors</note> would hardly venture a lawsui<corr resp="editor">[t]</corr><lb/>
with his majesty and that it was his Opinion the Crown would <sic corr="compel">compell</sic> t<corr resp="editor">[hem]</corr><lb/>
to sell the grant and vest it in the Crown Again with such <sic corr="Elation">Eallation</sic> do<corr resp="editor">[es]</corr><lb/>
our <sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General treat your lordships Estates which are granted under<lb/>
the kings broad Seal and have been allowed and <sic corr="Confirmed">Confirmd</sic> by such a su<corr resp="editor">[cc]</corr><lb/>
ession of Crowned heads</p>

<p>Indeed all our Governours in the time of my Agency h<corr resp="editor">[as]</corr><lb/>
treated the Grant and me too with a great deal of Civility and Calm respe<corr resp="editor">[ct]</corr><lb/>
Particularly our Present Governour whose business it chiefly is to take <corr resp="editor">[. . . ]</corr><lb/>
of Asserting the kings boundary to his lands whose Calm and tempera<corr resp="editor">[te]</corr><lb/>
<sic corr="carriage">carriadges</sic> both in this and all other matters <sic corr="has">hath</sic> been very Exemplar<corr resp="editor">[y]</corr></p>

<p>I must Confess if the <sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General can by the strength of<lb/>
his interest compass bringing your Lordships grant Again into the<lb/>
hands of the Crown he will gain a Considerable <note target="n7">Perquisite</note> to the <corr resp="editor">[pro]</corr><lb/>
fits of his Place (As it will be to <note target="n8">Mr Auditor Blair's</note> the Commiss<corr resp="editor">[ary's]</corr><lb/>

too will never return much Profit to me in my time but the lands above<lb/>
<sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> are very large and Extensive and said to be wonderfully good<lb/>
and may in time be a vast Addition to your lordships Estate</p>

<p>Thus my lord I have laid these matter fully before your <lb/>

your Lordships Estate be taken Away without any Opposition And I<lb/>
shall <sic corr="beg">begg</sic> <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> lordship to be very Plain in your directions to me whether<lb/>
I shall persist in Prosecuting this Affair to settlement of your Lordships<lb/>

<p>There is one thing more I shall take the liberty to mention to your <lb/>
Lordship In these late years since the Backwoods have come to be seated thick <lb/>
with inhabitants abundance of Peoples are making daily searches after mines <lb/>
in the mountainous barren Lands <sic corr="it is">tis</sic> the Current Opinion that there are very <lb/>
rich Ores in some of these mountains if any could be so lucky to find them out <lb/>
There are now within your lordships grant Two Iron furnaces Erected that <lb/>
are brought to Pretty good Perfections and there is Plenty of Iron Ore I believe <lb/>
as good as in the world the two Furnaces belong the one to <name type="city">Bristol</name> the other to <lb/>
<name type="city">London</name> There are two Places in the back woods also that have some <corr resp="editor">[veins?]</corr> <lb/>
of Copper ore that are at a great distance from water <sic corr="Carriage">Carriadge</sic> and will be <lb/>
Attended with very great charges to do any thing with them There is a Compa<add place="supralinear">[ny]</add><lb/>
of Bristol <abbr expan="Merchants">Merchts</abbr> that have sent in men <sic corr="skilled">skilld</sic> in those Affairs to search <lb/>
into the bowels of the Earth after this Copper Ore but some of them make hea:<lb/>

<p>I never yet Could find any directions from the Proprietors <corr resp="editor">[of]</corr> <lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Propietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.  (For sources, see those listed at the end of the <xref to="/users/berkeley/#Northern Neck"> discussion of the Proprietary</xref> on the home page.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] "The governor's Council, also known as the Council of State or simply the Council, consisted of about a dozen of colonial Virginia's wealthiest and most prominent men. Beginning in the 1630s the Crown appointed Council members. . . . Crown appointments were lifetime appointments. From 1625, when Virginia became a royal colony, until the outbreak of the American Revolution (1775-1783), the Council members advised the royal governor or his deputy, the lieutenant governor, on all executive matters. The Council and the governor together constituted the highest court in the colony, known initially as the Quarter Court and later as the General Court. The Council members also served as members of the General Assembly; from the first meeting of the assembly in 1619 until 1643 the governor, Council members, and burgesses all met in unicameral session. After 1643 the Council members met separately as the upper House of the General Assembly."

<note id="n5">[5] "The receiver-generalship was a royal appointment" and the official was required to give bond both to the lord of the treasury and to the governor. "Those who filled the office of receiver-general were practially all councillors. . . . The duties of the receiver-general included the receiving of the quit-rents, the revenue arising from the export duty of two shillings per hogshead on tobacco, the one penny per pound on tobacco exported from Virginia . . .  the port duty, which was the revenue arising from the fifteen pence per ton on all vessels arriving in the colony, and all funds of the colony not received by the treasurer. . . .  He paid out of the revenue . . .  the salaries of the officers of the colony, also those of the auditor-general of the colonies and the solicitor of Virginia affairs, both of whom lived in England. All the public expenses of the colony, except, of course, those paid out of the funds held by the treasurer, were paid out of the funds received in his office. . . .  He of course reported to the lords of the treasury all payments made on the order of the governor. The accounts of the revenues and the reports of disbursements forwarded to the lords of the treasury were certified to by the auditor and the governor, and sent by the governor."

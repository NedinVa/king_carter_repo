<p>I receiv'd a letter from <note n="MP2">Alderman Perry</note> of <abbr expan="December">Dec:</abbr> date acqua=<lb/>
inting me that your Lordship hath been with him to let him know how you should<lb/>
<sic corr="wish">wisht</sic> your rent which now <sic corr="entirely">intirely</sic> belongs to yourself <note n="WC"><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Cages</note> time being expired<lb/>
In the month after and that he should accordingly pay it and he further tells me<lb/>
your lordship wanted to know whether I should be willing to <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr>ing <sic corr="lease">leas</sic> after the<lb/>
old one was Expired In answer I Acquainted him the <sic corr="lease">leas</sic> would be out in <abbr expan="September">Sep</abbr> 1731<lb/>
that I was grown old and infirm and that we were fallen into such wretched times<lb/>
by the Poor Price of <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr> in which your Lordships rents are always Paid when that<lb/>
Commodity is worth little that I did not know what to say to it However in regard I had<lb/>
so long <sic corr="through">thro</sic> so great a Part of my life <sic corr="served">servd</sic> in your Affairs both in your Ancestors<lb/>
and in your Own time I adventured to give him instructions to take a new <sic corr="lease">leas</sic> out from<lb/>
<abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> Lordship and that so soon as your lordship shall <sic corr="please">pleas</sic> to Transact it of this<lb/>
I suppose you have been Acquainted by this time</p>

<p>I also told him it was some questions with me whether it would<lb/>
be Proper for me to have a new Power from <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> lordship only and whether it is <lb/>
necessary I alter the <sic corr="style">stile</sic> of the grants of your lands for Hitherto I have gran<lb/>
ted them in the names of your Lordship and <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Cage as devisee in trust of my<lb/>
<note target="n1">lady Fairfax's</note> Will that it was my thoughts however not withstanding your<lb/>
Lordship had the <sic corr="Entire">Intire</sic> right to the profits of the Estate yet the trust in <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr><lb/>
Cage is still subscribing and that the Grant should go on In the same <sic corr="style">stile</sic> but in<lb/>
this I must submit to better judgements</p>

<p>I also Acquainted Alderman Perry that upon the Crowns<lb/>
having granted several <sic corr="Patents">Pattents</sic> for land According to the best information<lb/>
I can get within the Plain boundaries of the Grant and Several more <sic corr="Patents">Pattents</sic><lb/>
are daily labouring after I had Entered a Caveat against the Passing any<lb/>
more <sic corr="Patents">Pattents</sic> within these bounds desiring Mr. Alderman to give your Lordship<lb/>
a full Accot of this matter as I doubt not he hath already or will soon do</p>

<p>Since which we have had a hearing before the <note n="WG"><abbr expan="Governor">Govr</abbr></note> &amp;<lb/>
Council and here with I send <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> Lordship <sic corr="copies">copys</sic> of all the Papers relating thereto<lb/>
as also <sic corr="Copies">Copys</sic> of some transactions in former Governours times relating to <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr><lb/>

<p>These Papers by a serious Perusal will fully inform<lb/>
your Lordship of the yeason <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>]</add> I go upon in Opposing these<lb/>

by the Crown All manner of Persons that Even I have talked with that <corr resp="editor">[have]</corr><lb/>
any knowledge of the Places are clear in Affirming that <sic corr="lies">lyes</sic> within <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> L<corr resp="editor">[ord]</corr><lb/>

some of this Papers forks above the Present Inhabitants the Southern b<corr resp="editor">[ranch]</corr><lb/>

keeps away to the westward and wears the Indians name of Cohonkocut as t<corr resp="editor">[here]</corr><lb/>
being no Comparison between the largeness of <sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> and Cononko<corr resp="editor">[cut]</corr><lb/>

many inhabitants seated of Maryland Maryland side a great way beyond <sic corr="Shenand">Chenand</sic><corr resp="editor">[oah]</corr><lb/>
Even Above branches that issue out of Cohonkocut as above <sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> No<corr resp="editor">[w if]</corr><lb/>
Cohonkocut is the Southern boundary to the Maryland grant why it should <lb/>
be Also the Northern boundary to your Lordships grand is beyond my ca<corr resp="editor">[paci]</corr><lb/>
ty to find an Argument for And yet our <note n="JG2"><sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General</note> declares it as hi<corr resp="editor">[s]</corr><lb/>
Opinion that the lands above <sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> are clearly the Kings and <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr><lb/>
to be granted as such and that my laying Claim in your lordships behalf <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr><lb/>
these lands that are clearly within the Express words of your grant is such<lb/>
presumption that will Endanger the grant itself Nay I have been willing<lb/>
that the <sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General should say At this Governours table after the che<corr resp="editor">[ck]</corr><lb/>
of this Caveat that he <abbr expan="believed">beleiv'd</abbr> the Proprietors would hardly venture a lawsui<corr resp="editor">[t]</corr><lb/>
with his majesty and that it was his Opinion the Crown would <sic corr="compel">compell</sic> t<corr resp="editor">[hem]</corr><lb/>
to sell the grant and vest it in the Crown Again with such <sic corr="Elation">Eallation</sic> do<corr resp="editor">[es]</corr><lb/>
our <sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General treat your lordships Estates which are granted under<lb/>
the kings broad Seal and have been allowed and <sic corr="Confirmed">Confirmd</sic> by such a su<corr resp="editor">[cc]</corr><lb/>
ession of Crowned heads</p>

<p>Indeed all our Governours in the time of my Agency h<corr resp="editor">[ath]</corr><lb/>
treated the Grant and me too with a great deal of Civility and Calm rese<corr resp="editor">[ct]</corr><lb/>
Particularly our Present Governour whose business it chiefly is to take <corr resp="editor">[. . . ]</corr><lb/>
of Asserting the kings boundary to his lands whose Calm and tempera<corr resp="editor">[te]</corr><lb/>
<sic corr="carriage">carriadges</sic> both in this and all other matters hath been very Exemplar<corr resp="editor">[y]</corr></p>

<p>I must Confess if the <sic corr="Receiver">Receivr</sic> General can by the strength of<lb/>
his interest compass bringing your Lordships grant Again into the<lb/>
hands of the Crown he will gain a Considerable Perquisite to the <corr resp="editor">[pro]</corr><lb/>
fits of his Place (As it will be to <note target="n3">Mr Auditor Blair's</note> the Commiss<corr resp="editor">[ary's]</corr><lb/>

Place by the favour of Mr <note target="n4">Horace <sic corr="Walpole">Wallpool </sic></note>and has his commission<lb/>

too will never return much Profit to me in my time but the lands above<lb/>
<sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> are very large and Extensive and said to be wonderfully good<lb/>
and may in time be a vast Addition to your lordships Estate</p>

<p>Thus my lord I have laid these matter fully before your <lb/>
Lordship and have though it my duty under the trust I am not to let<lb/>
your Lordships Estate be taken Away without any Opposition And I<lb/>
shall <sic corr="beg">begg</sic> <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> lordship to be very Plain in your directions to me whether<lb/>
I shall persist in Prosecuting this Affair to settlement of your Lordships<lb/>
<sic corr="boundaries">boundarys</sic> or if your lordship is pleased to be satisfyed in being <abbr expan="confined">confin'd</abbr><lb/>
to <sic corr="Shenandoah">Chenandoah</sic> to the Westward and to <sic corr="lose">loos</sic> the little Fork to the Southward<lb/>

<sic corr="althogh">altho</sic> I never yet could see any reason for it Be <abbr expan="pleased">pleas'd</abbr> to let me have your instru<lb/>

<p>In the late controversy I had with <note n="HD"><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Drysdale</note> our then <abbr expan="governor">govr</abbr><lb/>
it <abbr expan="Appeared">Appear'd</abbr> that both your lordship and <abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Cage <sic corr="relied">relyed</sic> Chiefly Upon Alder-<lb/>

Controversy relating to the boundarys and may be Prepared to make Appli-<lb/>

<sic corr="believing">beleiving</sic> your Lordship will still think it necessary to <sic corr="desire">disire</sic> his Assistance</p>
 
<p>There is one thing more I shall take the liberty to mention to your <lb/>
Lordship In these late years since the Backwoods have come to be seated thick <lb/>
with inhabitants abundance of Peoples are making daily searches after mines <lb/>
in the mountainous barren Lands <sic corr="it is">tis</sic> the Current Opinions that there are very <lb/>
rich Ores in some of these mountains if any could be so lucky to find them out <lb/>
There are now within your lordships grant Two Iron furnaces Erected that <lb/>
are brought to Pretty good Perfections and there is Plenty of Iron Ore I believe <lb/>
as good as in the world the two Furnaces belong the one to Bristol the other to <lb/>
London There are two Places in the back woods also that have some <corr resp="editor">[veins?]</corr> <lb/>
of Copper ore that are at a great distance from water <sic corr="Carriage">Carriadge</sic> and will be <lb/>
Attended with very great charges to do any thing with them There is a Compa <lb/>
of Bristol <abbr expan="Merchants">Merchts</abbr> that have sent in men <sic corr="skilled">skilld</sic> in those Affairs to search <lb/>
into the bowels of the Earth after this Copper Ore but some of them make hea<lb/>
vy Complaints to me that the terms of your Lordships Grants your lands <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr> <lb/>
are too hard and discouraging having An Exception of All royal mines <lb/>
and a full third of All lead Copper Tin Coals Iron &amp;c: I tell these go<corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr> <lb/>
men I follow the steps of my Predecessors they made the limit a<corr resp="editor">[. . . ]</corr> be<corr resp="editor">[fore]</corr> <lb/>
my time I dare not make any Alteration without Particular <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr><lb/>

<pb n="4"/><lb/><lb/>
but to sooth them a little I told <corr resp="editor">[them]</corr> I would try the matter before your Lord<corr resp="editor">[ship]</corr><lb/>
Upon the great <sic corr="discouragement">discouragment</sic> they say there is by the large <corr resp="editor">[. . . ]</corr>tions <lb/>

be at And at last it may be miss of finding any veins of Ore that may be worth <lb/>
while they threaten to discontinue their Searches </p>

<p>I never yet Could find any directions from the Proprietors <corr resp="editor">[. . .]</corr> <lb/>
the <sic corr="terms">termes</sic> respecting the Ores the Grants should be made upon Upon <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>]</add> the p<corr resp="editor">[rior?]</corr> <lb/>

<p>I find in <note n="PL"><abbr expan="Colonel">Colo</abbr> Ludwells</note> book of grants the Exceptions to m <corr resp="editor">[ines]</corr> <lb/>

Mss. 30306, British Library, London, from the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Propietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.</note>

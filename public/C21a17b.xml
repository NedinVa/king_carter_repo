<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry Sr. and Jr., January 17,1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah Perry and his grandson of the same name, January 17,1721, conerning his recent acquisition of the lease of the Virginia agency for the Northern Neck proprietary, the financial hardship he anticipates from it, and the poor condition of the records he has received from the agent of Edmund Jenings, the former holder of the lease. He asks the Perrys to persuade Lord Fairfax and Colonel Cage to enter a correspondence with him regarding the affairs of the propriety, and to attempt to have these men bring influence on the Crown to direct the governor of Virginia to be friendly to the proprietary's affairs. He needs a much stronger "power" concerning the granting of lands from the proprietary, and directs the Perrys to obtain one for him similar to the one he had had from Lady Fairfax when he had been agent before.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note><lb/><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] The repetition of the phrase "my own" has been written in another hand, not that of the clerk or of Carter, but a contemporary one. It may have been added to clarify the drafting clerk's writing for the clerk writing out the final copy. </note><lb/><lb/>

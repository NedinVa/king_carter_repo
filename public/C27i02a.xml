<p>The news of the <note target="n1">Kings Death</note> is Attended with <lb/>so many Circumstances there Seems hardly room left to disbelieve <lb/>it and yet that the King Should <sic corr="die">dye</sic> at Hanover the latter End of June <lb/>and that the news Should be in new York above a fortnight ago its <lb/>pretty Difficult to be Accounted for,</p>

<p>The Solicitation of <note target="n2">Mr. <sic corr="Fontaine">Fountain</sic></note> and the Intercession <lb/>of so many worthy Gentlemen hath prevaild with me to reprieve <lb/><note target="n3"><sic corr="Vidal">Vidall</sic></note> <sic corr="although">altho</sic> I must own to you I have very little Compassion <lb/>for persons Convicted of his Crime and let what mincing soever <lb/>be made use of in his favour It appeard very plainly to me <lb/>from the Testimony against him as well as the rest that his heart was <lb/>fully prepared for perpetrating the blackest of <del>Crimes</del> <add place="supralinear"><sic corr="Villianies">Vilianys</sic></add> <sic corr="Although">Altho</sic> the <lb/><sic corr="design">designe</sic> was laid with the greatest Improbability of Success, but tht. <lb/>was no foundation of merit in the Contrivors however Charity Should <lb/>Cover a multitude of Sins And may <sic corr="we">wee</sic> all meet with mercy in the <lb/>day of our distress Pray give my Service to Mr. <sic corr="Fontaine">Fountain</sic> whose <lb/>Concern in this affair hath had a great Influence upon me</p>

<p>I hope <note n="NH">Colonel Harrison</note> will be so <sic corr="Successful">Successfull</sic> in <note target="n4">his En<lb/>terprize</note> that our Frontier people in those parts will remain quiet <lb/>and unmolested in the Enjoyment of their little alls that some but <lb/>the <sic corr="Brutes">Bruits</sic> will Envy them</p>

<p>When I hear of your health so soon when but a few <lb/>days before I had an Accot. of your life being in a great deal of dan<lb/>ger I cannot forbear having Some remains of hope <del>of our</del><add place="supralinear">that the report of the</add> Kings <del>decease be<lb/>ing yet alive</del>  <sic corr="Although accompanied">Altho accompanyd</sic> with such Strong Circumstances <lb/>may yet prove a mistake My Gout hath proved more favorable <lb/>to me <sic corr="than">then</sic> my wishes I am Still lame my foot and Ankle <sic corr="Swelled">Swelld</sic> <lb/>and Cant wear a <sic corr="Shoe">Shooe</sic> I heartily wish you your firm health &amp; am </p>

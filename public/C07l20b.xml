<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Francis Lee, December 20, 1707</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Francis Lee, December 20, 1707, that he has written before of the safe arrival of Ralph Wormeley's sons in the colony, and that he hopes their education proves acceptable to their relations and to the "extravagant" clothing and fittings they have brought in. He hopes their estates will provide a living to support this style which he thinks Ralph's will while John's will be much less. He continues that he has been reviewing the papers relating to his work as one of the Wormeleys' trustees, and requests Lee send him several accounts of sales of tobacco shipped to him for sale as he must be ready to account to the other trustees for his actions.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

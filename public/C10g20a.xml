<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Goodwin, 1710 July 20</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant John Goodwin, July 20,
1710, that he must once again take up the affairs of the estate of
Ralph Wormeley although the sons are now in charge of their affairs.
He reminds Goodwin that in an account current of September 3, 1708,
Goodwin had reported that the estate had a balance with him of more
than 182 pounds against which Carter had drawn only one small bill
for four pounds to Doctor Lomax. He chastises Goodwin for not having
credited young Ralph Wormeley with this large balance, and further,
for his failure to pay a small bill sent by Ralph forcing Ralph to
draw a new bill and pay the fees. He adds that even with the goods
sent this year, Goodwin remains in debt to Ralph about 90 pounds and
that "I order &amp; now desire you to" give the sons "the ballance of
the aforesd account to the Credit of their next account, Currt." He
concludes that Goodwin ought to make good the fees incurred by Ralph
on the protested bill.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of

"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been

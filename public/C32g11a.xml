<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, July 11, 1732</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, July 11, 1732, to assure the merchant that he has pleased Carter by refusing to give Lewis Burwell, then a student at Cambridge, any money and directing him not ever to do so. Carter points out an error in an account, complains of the abysmal state of the tobacco trade, and writes of bills of exchange.</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Carter refers to Lewis Burwell (1711 or 1712-1756), his grandson by Elizabeth Carter Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721); Carter was his guardian. He was educated at Eton and  was at Cambridge when Carter wrote. He would inherit considerable property (contrary to Carter's gloomy assertions to Dawkins) and live at "Fairfield," Gloucester County. He would be president of the Council in 1750-1751. (<cit><bibl n="B42">Kneebone <hi rend="italics">et al.</hi>,  <title>Dictionary of Virginia Biography.</title>  2:434-5.</bibl></cit> and <cit><bibl n="B3">Carleton. <title>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 114.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The <hi rend="italics">Bailey</hi> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. (<cit><bibl>Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</bibl></cit> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins 1732 May 12 refers to "your ship Bailey." as does a letter of 1738 May 10 from Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10.)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] A score is twenty, so fourscore is eighty.</note>

<note id="n4">[4]  Henry Fitzhugh (1706-1742) of "Eagle's Nest," Stafford County, was educated at Oxford, and married Lucy Carter (1715-1763), Robert Carter's fourteenth child, in 1730. They had  four children; after Fitzhugh's death, she married Nathaniel Harrison (1713-1791).  He was a burgess and militia officer.

Rutland, <title>The Papers of George Mason, 1725-1792.</title> [Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1970]. I:lii</bibl></cit>; and extensive generalogical notes, "Fitzhugh Family," in volumes 7 and 8 of <title>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.</title>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11. <cit><bibl><title>Virginia Tax Records.</title> [Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, Inc., 1983.] p. 539.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel named the <hi rend="italics"> Loyalty</hi>in 1729-1730. (Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter's letters to John Pemberton 1730 April 15 and 1731 August 4.)</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas Evans, July 22, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Evans, July 22, 1723, to clarify his order for medicines, and to order new sword belts which he wishes Evans personally to select. He encloses a bill of lading (not present) for 8 hogsheads of tobacco. He then writes bitterly of reports in the colony that a bill near passage in the House of Commons will prevent the importation into England of stripped and lug tobacco which he attributes to the lobbying efforts of Scots and outport interests. He notes that a expected fine crop of tobacco in the colony has been severely reduced by hard rains, and states that Heaven is joining with the efforts of the lobbyists to ruin the Virginia planters who pay full duties on their imports into England.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to the brief heading on the draft.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Sweetscented tobacco was one of two major types grown in Carter's day. It was mild compared to the stronger oronocco. Sweetscented required "a typer of soil of limited distribution" and "was largely confined to the banks of the great rivers, the James, York, Rappahannock, and  Potomac." (<cit><bibl>Arthur Pierce Middleton. <title>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</title> Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.  p. 97</bibl></cit>) </note>

<note id="n2">[2]  "The lowest grade [of tobacco] was known as lugs as early as 1686. . . ." (<cit><bibl>Philip A. Bruce. <title>Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century: An Inquiry into the Material Condition of the People, Based on Original and Contemporaneous Records.</title> [New York: MacMillan and Co., 1896], I:442 online at <xref to="Ext14">"Classics of American Colonial History."</xref> http://www.dinsdoc.com/bruce-1-7.htm</bibl></cit>) </note>

<note id="n3">[3] The trading policies of Scots merchants were of considerable concern to Virginia planters and English  merchants at this time, and the matter came before Parliament in 1723. Vessels sent by Scots were crewed by captains and factors authorized to pay good prices in Virginia which enabled them to  obtain full cargoes. English merchants argued that the only way the Scots could afford to pay such good prices was their ability to avoid paying duties on the tobacco at home. Micajah Perry appeared before Parliament and gave statistics of the duties paid by his firm in earlier years and the far smaller amounts paid in the past several years because his ships could not obtain full cargoes in Virginia.

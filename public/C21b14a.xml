<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Bryan Blundell, February 14, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant, Bryan Blundell, February 14, 1721, concerning a ship of his commanded by Nat Milby on which Carter tried to take freight at &pound;8 per ton. Milby raised the price to &pound;9, a rate which Carter has not paid in a long time for shipping to Liverpool, but the ship was filled quickly. Carter asks Blundell to give his greetings to Captains Tarlton and Everad.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Bryan Blundell (c. 1674-1756) was a prominent Liverpool merchant, mayor in 1721-1722. He was later to become involved in the slave trade, and is remembered as the founder of the Blue Coat School for the Poor, having given up the sea to oversee its affairs.

<note id="n2">[2] The Tarletons were prominent Liverpool merchants, and Carter probably had met one who commanded a ship to Virginia.</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to  Lord Fairfax and William Cage, August 21, 1721</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes August 21, 1721, to  Lord Fairfax, the owner of the Northern Neck proprietary, and William Cage, trustee under Fairfax's mother's will, concerning affairs of the proprietary on which Carter holds a lease. He encloses bills of exchange from Edmund Jenings, the former lease holder, for &pound;400 in partial payment of debts due, and noting that Jenings requests that the bills not be presented for payment for as long as possible. Micajah Perry has been ordered to pay the proprietor's rent for the year 1720, and Carter will plan to pay at the end of each year. He complains about the bad bargain the lease is proving as he has received less than &pound;20 in income so far.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to persons abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note>This is the recipient's copy, signed by Carter, and has considerable damage along the left side. Endorsed "Coll [. . .]; there is no address.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Thomas Lee (1690-1750) was the son of Richard Lee II, and nephew of Edmund Jenings; he would build "Stratford," and succeed RC on the Council. He had been deputy agent for the proprietors until his uncle returned from England in 1715.</note>

</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, July 11, 1732, reiterating  his  often expressed complaints about the low prices realized by his tobacco, and to ask that Perry consider giving him a discount because of the large amounts of cash Carter has had in his hands. He notes some problems with the Merchants Hundred account, and reports bills of exchange.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1]  Carter Burwell (1716-1756) was Robert Carter's grandson by his daughter Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721). Carter Burwell would live at "Carter's Grove," and would marry Lucy Grymes in 1738. (<cit><bibl n="B3">Carleton. <title>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 128.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. (See <cit><bibl><xref to="http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm">"Bill of Exchange"</xref> in the online Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms: the Truth vs. the Scam.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Peter Whiting was a justice and sheriff in Gloucester County. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]: 119, 134, 173. </bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5] This is probably Francis Willis (1690-<hi rend="italics">post</hi> 1749) of "'White Hall," Gloucester Co., VA. He was a member of the House of Burgesses in 1748. ("Willis Family Genealogy"  (http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~marshall/esmd73.htm as of 5/21/02; and <cit><bibl>"Willis Family." <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 1st ser. 5(1896): 24-27, 171-176; 6(1897): 27-29, 206-214.)</bibl></cit>)</note>


<note id="n6">[6] William Bassett (1671-1723) of Eltham, New Kent County was a member of the Assembly, militia officer, and member of t he Council. His first wife was Joanna Burwell, daughter of Lewis Burwell, which would have connected him to the Carter family and may explain Carter's reference. (<cit><bibl>"Featured Bassett: TheBassetts of Eltham, Virginia" in the Bassett Family Association Newsletter, May 2005. http://www.bassettbranches.org/newsletters/2005/20050515/20050515.shtml. 9/1/2006;</bibl></cit> and numerous references in <cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]. </bibl></cit>)</note>


<note id="n7">[7] Several vessels named <hi rend="italics">The Loyalty</hi> sailed to Virginia. One commanded by Francis Wallis cleared from Poole for Virginia in 1726. Captain Edward Loxam commanded  a vessel of this name in 1729-1732 as did James Tarleton in 1732. (Survey Report 09727 extracting "Public Record Office Class E 190/915/9.

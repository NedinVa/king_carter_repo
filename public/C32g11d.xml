<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry, July 11, 1732</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, July 11, 1732, reiterating  his  often expressed complaints about the low prices realized by his tobacco, and to ask that Perry consider giving him a discount because of the large amounts of cash Carter has had in his hands. He notes some problems with the Merchants Hundred account, and reports bills of exchange.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

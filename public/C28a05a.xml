<note>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Fairfax Harrison speculated that Waugh Darnell may have been a son of David Darnell, involved in a "Stafford <hi rend="italics">cause celebre</hi> in May 1690" for attempting to send "trash tobacco" on board a trading ship, and that his first name may have come from his father's relationship with the noted and controversial preacher John Waugh. (<cit><bibl n="B4">Harrison. <title>Landmarks. . . ,</title></bibl></cit> pp. 1341-33,  141-2.) </note>

<note id="n1">[1] James Carter (1684-1743), of Stafford County, was the younger brother of Carter's dear friend and associate, Captain Thomas Carter of Lancaster County, and was one of Carter's chief managers. (<cit><bibl>Joseph Lyon Miller, "Captain Thomas Carter and His Descendants," <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 1st ser., 17(1908-09): 275-285.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2]Quit rent was the term used for "a (usually small) rent paid by a freeholder . . .  in lieu of services which might otherwise be required; a nominal rent paid (esp. in former British colonial territories to the Crown) as an acknowledgement of tenure," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online</title>. Oxford University Press.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Robert Alexander (d. 1735) was a resident of Prince William County who would become a justice in 1734. Carter used the title of "major" which probably meant that Alexander was a militia officer. (<cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:239. </bibl></cit>)</note>

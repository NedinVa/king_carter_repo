<note><hi rend="italics">Source copy consulted: </hi>  Lancaster
County Marriage Bonds, 1718, I, 12, Archives Research Services,
Library of Virginia, Richmond. This is the recipient's copy and  is
entirely in the hand of and is signed by RC as is noted by the use
of italics. William Dare was clerk
of Lancaster County at this time. The single sheet has lost a portion
which has removed much of the address on the reverse but it probably
read: "[William Da]re | [Lan]castr" since the last letters remain. 
Cloth tape obscures portions of the contemporary docket. What can be
read shows:  "July 28th 1718 | [del]ivered to T C." A docket in a
later hand reads, "Man Page | to | Judith Carter" and scrawled below
this in another hand is "1718." (<cit><bibl n="B36">Dobyns <hi
rend="italics">et al. </hi> <title>Within the Court House at
Lancaster. </title> p. 15.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence. The return
address, county, and colony have been
added for clarity to this unheaded letter.</note><lb/>
 
 
<note id="n1">[1] RC's daughter Judith (1695-c. 1750) married Mann
Page of "Rosewell," Gloucester County.</note>
 
<note id="n2">[2] Thomas Carter (1672-1733) was the second of that
name in Lancaster County, and may have been RC's first cousin as
there is evidence that their fathers were brothers. He lived at
"Barford" in the northern part of the county. (<cit><bibl>Catherine

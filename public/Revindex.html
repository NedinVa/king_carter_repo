<BLOCKQUOTE>This site includes transcriptions of the diary, correspondence, and papers of 
the richest and most important man of his day in Virginia, who owned at his death at least 
300,000 acres containing many farms and plantations that produced tobacco and other crops for 
sale, some 1,000 slaves to work those plantations, and large sums of money invested in Virginia 
and in England. Robert Carter was a member of the Council of Virginia, was acting governor, 
and a political power in the colony. He had received a classical education in England, and 
corresponded widely both within the colony and with merchants in England.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>While interest in making Robert Carter's letters generally available to scholars and the 
public began in 1938 with the publication of Louis B. Wright's edition of a letter book of Carter's 
that had strayed west from Virginia to the Huntington Library in California, the present project 
traces itself to the late 1940's. At that time, more letter books and a diary of Carter's were 
discovered. Three of the letter books were acquired by the Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, 
and four letter books and the diary by the University of Virginia Library, Charlottesville. Francis 
L. Berkeley, Jr., then curator of manuscripts at the University of Virginia Library, began work 
immediately on a project to publish these texts. Transcripts were prepared according the editing 
principals of the time: punctuation and capital letters were added to sentences, abbreviations 
expanded, and the like. Mr. Berkeley continued to work on the project until he left the Library 
to become executive assistant to the president of the University in 1961. One of his plans for 
retirement was to resume the editorial work which he did after 1974 for several years. Sadly, a 
progressive eye disease put an end to his dream, and he was forced to turn over to the current 
editor all of the material he had accumulated over the years.</P> 
 
<P>I worked on the project sporadically during a busy career as curator of manuscripts, and 
later, as the first director of special collections at the University of Virginia Library. As I had written 
my master's thesis on "King" Carter, and had read all the letters and the diary for that work, I 
was familiar with the texts. </P> 
 
<P>My work has been supported by the University of Virginia Library Faculty Research 
Committee which provided a number of grants of released time as well as funds for the 
employment of student assistants. My thanks go to the Committee for its support, and to Sherry 
Armstrong, Milly Fife, and Susan Garrahan for their cheerful and invaluable assistance. Most 
important of all was a 1988 grant from the Virginia Foundation for History and Public Policy, to 
which I also extend my thanks, that enabled me to take a semester's leave from my duties at the 
Library during which I completed new transcripts of the letters to the literal style of today's 
editorial work, and wrote footnotes for many of the letters. My intent remained book publication 
for the texts, and I prepared an initial manuscript for the early letters.</P> 
 
<P>My interest in computer work and the early development of electronic texts at the University 
of Virginia Library and exposed me to this process, and to HTML and SGML tagging. My 
membership in the Association for Documentary Editing kept me aware of the work of the Model 
Editions Partnership whose reports have been particularly helpful. As I approached my own 
retirement, I decided that I would work immediately on an electronic edition of the Carter texts 
making use of the facilities and interest of the Electronic Text Center of the University of Virginia 
Library and its director, David Seaman. This electronic edition will place Carter's texts before 
those interested much more rapidly than otherwise, and will add to the body of sources readily 
available to researchers interested in early eighteenth-century Virginia.</P>  
 
<H3><a name="Extant Texts">The Extant Texts</a></H3>   
 
<p>The texts consist chiefly of nine volumes of copies of outgoing letters, 1701-1710, and 
1720-1732, drafted by one or another of several clerks or occasionally by one of his sons, from 
Carter's dictation or general directions. In addition there are: a one-volume diary, 1723-1728, in 
Carter's hand; a dozen or more recipients' copies of letters; a slightly number of 
nineteenth-century transcripts of some letters dated between 1717 and 1719 copied from a letter book 
not extant as well as for other letters through the time of Carter's death; and a few letters addressed to Carter. No texts have been found for 1711-1714 and for July 28, 1730, until June 16,  1731, and there are only a few recipient's copies of letters in 1725-1726. This project deals chiefly with texts written out at Carter's direction by a variety of persons in addition to the text of his diary in his hand.</p> 
 
<p>Approximately 800 letters survive, and of these, some 750 are drafts found in the letter 
books. These texts are reasonably easy to read, the major problems coming from the variety of 
handwritings and styles of punctuation and capitalization of the clerks with the additional 
complication of a number of texts available only in nineteenth-century transcripts. The disorder 
in chronology of the letters is considerable in some of the letter books because the clerks 
apparently would pick up the nearest book when Carter was ready to dictate. In this edition, strict 
chronological order has been adhered to, with diary entries preceding letter texts of the same date. 
If there is more than one letter with the same date, the letters are in order alphabetically by the 
recipients' last names.</p> 
 
<p>Of the surviving recipients' copies of his letters (generally written out by clerks and signed 
by Carter), perhaps three or four are duplicated in the letter books.  Many of the extant letters are 
addressed to merchants or other persons in Britain, and Carter followed the colonial practice of 
sending duplicate letters by different ships. Only one such example survives. The Huntington 
Library has two recipient's texts of the letter of June 30, 1724, to Colonel William Cage, both 
of them written by clerks, signed by Carter and sealed with his arms, one sent 
 <q>"per the Princess Carolina, Captain Holladay,</q>"  and the other  <q>"per the Spotswood, Captain 
Bagnell.</q>" </p> 
 
<p>The diary covers the years 1723-1728, and is in very bad physical condition, the edges of 
many pages having flaked off.  It is difficult to read at times due to Carter's carelessness and his 
habit of abbreviating words. Frank Berkeley wrote of the diary that it is  <q>"highly telegraphic 
in style, almost as terse as shorthand at times in its frugality of expression, and almost totally 
lacking in punctuation.</q>"  Carter's spelling was inconsistent at best, and entirely freewheeling 
at its worst. He was voluble only in regard to his health in this diary, and often frustratingly refers 
to his  <q>"other book</q>"  where details of happenings apparently were recorded. The poor 
physical condition of the diary with its numerous holes and tears in the text have made the use of 
large numbers of square brackets in the transcript necessary.</p> 
 
<H3><a name="Transcription">The Following Rules for Transcription and for Dates Have Been Used:</a></H3>   
 
<UL>
  <LI>The spelling, grammar, capitalization, and punctuation of the original 
  texts have been followed insofar as possible, given the extreme difficulty of 
  duplicating some of the conventions of eighteenth-century handwriting on a computer screen. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Superior letters and clear abbreviations are retained. When an 
  abbreviation is unclear, it is expanded with square brackets to indicate 
  editorial additions. Abbreviations and  original spellings have often been tagged with the modern expanded word; to read a text with modern spelling, click on that link beneath each index entry. <BR><BR>
  <LI>The thorn is expanded to "th" in all instances. <BR><BR>
  <LI>The various "tailed P" symbols used for "per," "pro," etc., are silently 
  expanded as appropriate. <BR><BR>
  <LI>The ampersand is retained throughout. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Dashes used as flourishes at the end of sentences are retained. <BR><BR>
  <LI>All dates are given Old Style (Julian Calendar) but with the year 
  beginning January 1st rather than March 25th in headings; the virgule and numbers for the 
  old year are dropped silently in headings, but are retained at the head of the transcript of the letter or diary entry. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Contracted words over which the clerks placed a tilde or a straight line 
  have been silently expanded. Carter's clerks used a stylized abbreviation -- 
  <Q>"hhds"</Q> -- for the word <Q>"hogsheads"</Q> in which the tail of the 
  <Q>"d"</Q> was not only swept up and to the left, as was common at the time, 
  but was then circled down and back across the three letters and down to form 
  the terminal <Q>"s."</Q> Because this abbreviation seems to incorporate a 
  tilde, the abbreviation <Q>"hhds</Q>" has been expanded silently when the 
  tilde is present. <BR><BR>
  <LI>Carter often dictated postscripts to letters and they are not necessarily found in the letter books  
  beneath the letter to which they pertain. Postscripts are added to the foot of the letter to which they pertain, and the date of the postscript is retained. Undated postscripts are added to the foot of the letter to which they pertain if it can be determined. If the letter cannot be identified, the undated postscript is given a tentative date determined by its place in the letter book. </LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Carter occasionally edited in his hand the texts that the clerks had written from his dictation. Such changes from the clerk's to  Robert Carter's hand are indicated by italics for Carter's handwriting, and a note to alert the reader.</LI>

<H3><a name="Short Life">A Brief Life of Robert Carter</a></H3> 
 
<P>Robert Carter lived his adult life in Lancaster County, Virginia, on the southern side of the 
Northern Neck peninsula, not far from the point at which the Rappahannock empties into 
Chesapeake Bay, where he was born in 1663 and died in 1732, at the home, 
 <q>"Corotoman,</q>"  established there by his father. He was educated in England by his 
father's direction, and acquired a life-long appreciation of books and reading, and the value of a 
good education. He inherited property from his father, and a sizeable estate on the death of his 
older half-brother John, but through his own business abilities and the opportunities that he seized, 
he had acquired well over 300,000 acres of land, nearly 1,000 slaves, and a considerable cash 
estate by the time of his death according to his obituary in London's <i>Gentleman's 
Magazine</i>. No other Virginian of his generation was so successful in his political career, 
in the marriages made by his children, and so ruthless in building his estate for the benefit of 
those children.</P> 
 
<P>He was astute in business, politics, and land speculation, and his fortune, political successes, 
and estates, vast even in a time of insatiability in land ownership, demonstrate his success. His 
acute sense of his own importance, and knowledge of the power that his wealth and political 
acumen had brought him, earned him the derisive nickname of  <q>"King,</q>"  
 
<P>His political power was firmly based in the inheritances that he received from his father, 
Colonel <name type="person">John Carter</name> (c. 1613-1669), from his older 
half-brother, Lt. Col. <name type="person">John Carter</name> (c. 1648-1690), and from 
family connections. John Carter, the immigrant,  made several voyages to Virginia before 
establishing himself there permanently between May 1638 and January 1641. Apparently he 
brought with him useful political connections and considerable money for he soon was chosen 
burgess for Nansemond River in <name type="place">Upper Norfolk County</name>. But 
his attention was further north; he acquired land by patent and purchase in what was then <name 
type="place">Charles River County</name> (to become Lancaster in 1751). Although he 
appears first in the <name type="county">Lancaster County</name> records in January 
1652, he had apparently not yet "seated" his land and had to obtain that April an act of the 
Assembly for an extension; he moved there soon afterwards. 
 
<p>Through his connections and his wealth, John Carter rose quickly to prominence in the 
colony, and by 1657 he was a member of the council. His five marriages produced only six 
children, several of whom died in infancy. Most important to Robert was his older half-brother, 
John, who raised him after their father died in 1669. </p> 
 
<P>John Carter I followed the custom of the time in bequeathing most of his property to his 
eldest son, but he made provision for Robert, leaving him 1,000 acres on a branch of Corotoman, 
one-third of his personal estate,  <q>"his mother's hoop ring &amp; christall necklace,</q>"  and 
a sixth part of his books. Most important for Robert were the specific instructions that his father 
wrote concerning his education. Robert was to have a tutor who would teach him both English and 
Latin. 
 
<p>John Carter II, who was about fifteen years older than his brother, obeyed their father's 
instructions, and furthered them by sending Robert home to England for higher education. The 
custom of the time was that boys were sent to England when they were nine or ten, and Robert 
probably sailed to England about 1673. From a letter of Robert's written late in his life when he 
was quarreling with his English factor, William Dawkins, over the education of his own sons and 
grandsons, we know that he spent at least six years in England, living in the home of merchant 
and family friend, Arthur Bailey, and learning from him, and from the opportunities presented by 
living with the merchant, much of the tobacco trade and its marketing end.</p> 
 
<p>Robert's education in England undoubtedly included thorough grounding in the Christian 
religion. Most of his schoolmasters would have been clergymen, and would have considered 
religious education a fundamental requirement of their curricula. While Robert always considered 
himself  <q>"of the Church of England way,</q>"  he was not intolerant of dissenters, and Louis 
B. Wright has written in several places of the books by Puritans and others in the libraries of both 
John Carters which Robert would have had access to before and after his years in England. He 
would purchase titles on religious subjects for his library, which included the books that he 
inherited from his brother and father, through the rest of his life. 
 
<P>Robert returned to Virginia about 1680 to take up the life of a Virginia gentleman on the 
modest estates he had been left by his father. He built a house on the home property at 
 <q>"Corotoman,</q>"  however, a brick story-and-a-half structure of three rooms. He lived in 
it until he moved into the larger two-story mansion which dominated the Corotoman landscape for 
a decade beginning about 1720.</P> 
 
<P>John Carter II continued much of the service and prominence that his father had established 
as the norm for the family. He is referred to as captain at first, but by 1672, his rank is that of 
lieutenant colonel, a title, presumably from his militia service, that he is accorded until his death.. 
He served as sheriff in 1673 and again in 1678, burgess, and at other times, he was collector of 
the levy.</P> 
 
<P>Unlike his younger brother, John Carter II was not obsessed with the acquisition of land. 
Checks of the land office records do not show that he took out any patents. Apparently running 
his farms successfully, raising his brother, and being active in county affairs were sufficient for 
him. He married first Elizabeth Hull prior to 1675 when he is named in the will of his 
father-in-law. This marriage produced one daughter, Elizabeth, who was to marry John Lloyd in 
1693. Elizabeth Hull Carter was dead by 1684 when Lancaster records mention a marriage 
between John Carter and Elizabeth Travers who outlived him to marry <name 
type="person">Christopher Wormeley</name>, dying herself in 1693.</P> 
 
<P>By 1688 it was apparent that John Carter's principal heir was to be his brother, and this 
greatly improved the latter's prospects. >Robert was married in that year to <name 
type="person">Judith Armistead</name>, daughter of <name type="person">John 
Armistead</name> of  <q>"Hesse,</q>"  <name type="place">Gloucester 
County</name>; their son, John, was born about 1689, and four other children followed, 
Elizabeth in 1692, Judith and Sarah who died in infancy, and a second Judith in 1695. Because 
no letters or other texts survive from this period of his life, little is known about his wife, or the 
early years of his children, but presumably the traditional Virginia custom was followed in raising 
and educating the Carter children. Having renounced the carefree life of the bachelor, Robert was 
considered ready for the types of public service that his father and brother had undertaken.</P> 
 
<P>Robert's first position was that of justice</ref> of the Lancaster Court, an office for 
which he took the required oaths on 10 June 1690. Election as a 
<rolename><vestryman</rolename> for <name type="organization">Christ Church 
Parish</name> followed on 8 November 1690; about a year later he was chosen 
<rolename>church warden</rolename>, a position he retained until his death. And service to 
the colony soon ensued with his election as <rolename>burgess</rolename> for the session 
beginning 1 April 1692. He was returned to every session of the Burgesses until 1699 with the 
exception of the two sessions held in 1693.</P> 
 
<P>As chairman of the <name type="organization">Committee of Propositions and 
Grievances</name> in 1695, Carter steered the members to present a protest against the actions 
of the Northern Neck proprietary agents, and the proprietary itself. This was his last effort of this 
sort because the appeal of acting as Virginia agent for the proprietors was soon to bring him over 
to their side.</P> 
 
<P>He took a leading role in the work of the House, and  <q>"in September 1696 Carter was 
elected <rolename>Speaker</rolename> over five other nominees. Carter was not chosen as 
Speaker for the 1698 session, but was in April 1699. Also at this session, the House chose Carter 
as <rolename>Treasurer</rolename> of the colony, an office which, as Jon Kukla has 
observed, was one usually associated with the Speaker. However, the House took the most unusual 
step of allowing Carter to retain the office of Treasurer even after his appointment to the 
<rolename>Council</rolename> was confirmed in England by the <name 
type="organization">Privy Council</name> on 14 December 1699. </P> 
 
<P>There is no indication in the surviving records that Carter had any formal training in the 
law, but he was interested in it. Most planters of his day found it necessary to learn something 
of the law because many served as justices. Service in the <name type="organization">House 
of Burgesses</name>, particularly assignment in 1695 to serve on a committee to revise the 
laws of the colony as the <name type="organization">Board of Trade</name> had ordered, 
may have spurred Robert Carter's  interest. By the time of his death, he had about 100 law books 
in his library, more than one-third of its total. He never hesitated to include references to the law 
in his letters.</P> 
 
<P>In colonial Virginia, one official post led quickly to others; a seat in the Council brought 
several posts with it. Carter was appointed on 3 June 1699 as <rolename>colonel</rolename> 
and <rolename>commander-in-chief</rolename> of the Lancaster-Northumberland counties 
militia; on November 11th of the same year the governor appointed him as <rolename>naval 
officer</rolename> and <rolename>receiver</rolename>, a post of value because of the 
considerable income it generated, and because of the power over one's neighbors that it meant</P> 
 
<p>By 1701, when the first of the extant letters was written by Robert Carter, he was already 
one of the most prominent men in the colony as a member of its council, and the significant events 
of the early portion of his life had occurred, including the death of his first wife in 1699 and his 
second marriage (to <name type="person">Elizabeth Landon Willis</name>, by whom he 
would have ten children) in 1701.  The letters dated between 1701 and 1710 included in this 
project reflect little of Carter's personal, political, and mercantile interests of that time because 
they are ones he wrote as one of the trustees of the children of his friend, Ralph Wormeley, and 
deal with their affairs rather than his own. There are a few that step outside his duties to his 
friend, and they show his interest in land acquisition, a topic that would occupy him all of the rest 
of his life.</p> 
 
<p>There is little extant on his first term as Virginia agent for the proprietors of the Northern 
Neck, an arrangement of importance to Carter because it gave him a taste of how profitable that 
office could be. A separate section of this project concerns Carter's work as the proprietor's 
Virginia agent.</p> 
 
<p>There are no extant texts for the years 1711-1714, one in 1715, none in 1716, and a few 
for the years 1717-1719 from various sources including some nineteenth-century copies made from 
a letter book no longer extant. Beginning with the year 1720 and continuing until Carter's death 
in August 1732, the record is fairly full, and a good picture of his management of his affairs, 
political interests, and daily routines can be drawn.</p> 
 
<p>The most important events of the last twenty-two years of his life were to be his term as 
acting governor of the colony after the death in July 1726 of Hugh Drysdale until the arrival of 
William Gooch in September 1727, and his second term as agent for the proprietors of the 
Northern Neck. By the time that Carter became acting governor, he was in his sixties and in poor 
health. His extant diary, kept between 1722 and 1728, gives information his concerns while 
tantalizing with references to his  <q>"other book</q>"  in which he apparently wrote more 
detailed entries. His drive to acquire land for his children led him to acquire in 1720 a lease of 
the propriety from Lord Fairfax, and to take patents on huge quantities of land moving ever 
westward in Virginia with his acquisitions.</p> 
 
<p>It is in his management of his highly successful agricultural operations and in his operation 
of the proprietary that our interest in him lies. The hundreds of letters that he wrote in this period 
and the one extant diary provide a wealth of information for those interested in Virginia in the 
early years of the eighteenth century. Management of his farms occupies much of Carter's time 
and his writings. The majority of his letters are written to British merchants consigning tobacco 
for sale, ordering goods for his family, servants and slaves, and the like, but as many of the 
merchants were at least old friends, there are frequent comments about Virginia events and people. 
Carter orders clothes, books, and newspapers for himself, writes about his poor health, and seeks 
favors ranging from wine to offices for his sons.</p> 
 
<p>Robert Carter was influential in his own day and left a family dynasty that continues to this 
day. At one time, he was estimated to have over 50,000 descendants including six governors of 
Virginia, three signers of the Declaration of Independence, and two presidents of the United 
States. Five sons and five daughters survived to marry well and were themselves prolific. His 
letters and other writings reveal his drive to establish this dynasty, and the skill and intelligence 
he brought to this effort.</p>

<H3><a name="Wormeley Estate">LETTERS CONCERNING THE ESTATE OF RALPH WORMELEY</a></H3> 
 
<p>The earliest letters of Robert Carter's that have been located -- fifty-three items 
dated between 1701 and 1710 -- concern the estate of his brother-in-law, Ralph 
Wormeley (1650-1701), member of the Council and Secretary of State of Virginia, who lived in 
very grand style at <place>"Rosegill"</place> <place> Middlesex County </place>, on 
the Rappahannock River. Carter had married Judith, and Wormeley Elizabeth, the daughters of 
<person>John Armistead</person> of <place> Gloucester County </place>.</p>  
<p>Wormeley, second of that name in Virginia, left two sons, Ralph (ca. 1681-1714) and John 
(1689-1727), and named them his executors. Because his sons were minors at the time of his 
death, his  <q>"dear friends and relations,</q>"  <person> Edmund Jenings </person>, 
Robert Carter, Thomas and <person> Gawin Corbin </person>, and <person> Edwin 
Thacker </person>, who were asked in Wormeley's will  <q>"to aid and assist</q>"  his sons 
in their duties, actually assumed control of the estate. All the trustees were planters but 
<person> Thomas Corbin </person> who had become a merchant in 
<place>London</place>. Carter was responsible for the Wormeley estates on the 
Rappahannock while Jenings supervised those on the York River near his home, "Ripon 
Hall."</p> 
 
<p>Personal relationships between Wormeley's  <q>"dear friends</q>"  were complicated. 
Wormeley and the Corbins were first cousins as their mothers were sisters, Alice and Agatha 
Eltonhead. A third Eltonhead sister, Eleanor, was Robert Carter's father's second (of five) wife. 
Gawin Corbin was also Wormeley's son-in-law, having married his daughter Katherine. Edmund 
Jenings was married to another daughter, Frances. Edwin Thacker was a cousin of Wormeley's 
through the Eltonheads.</p> 
 
<p>Extracts from Carter's letters concerning the estate were published in 
the <bibl id="A21"><i>William and Mary Quarterly</i></bibl> in 1909,and were mentioned 
in an earlier article in the <bibl id="A20"><i>Virginia Magazine of History and 
Biography</i></bibl>. Both articles referred to the volume containing the originals as one 
used chiefly to record processioners' returns for Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County; the 
volume was then in the Lancaster County courthouse. Robert Carter was a vestryman of this 
parish and apparently had custody of the volume. Care of his friend's family would have been a 
religious duty to Carter, and he had his clerks use the volume to record copies of his letters 
concerning the Wormeley estate. The volume was located in Archives Research Services, Library 
of Virginia, Richmond, where it is described as: <cit>Church Records, Christ Church Parish, 
Lancaster County, Processioners' Returns, 1711-1783, and Wormeley Estate Papers, 1701-1710 
(Acc. No. 30126).</cit></p>

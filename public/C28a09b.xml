<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </note>

<note>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Alexander Spotswood (1646-1740) had been the governor from 1710 to 1722.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</note>

<note id="n3">[3] Carter uses "regiment" to mean the government or administration, a meaning obsolete today.</note>

 <note id="n4"> [4]  Richard Hickman (d. 1732) had been deputy clerk of Middlesex County in 1709. After Governor Hugh Drysdale's death, the Council appointed him to manage the Governor's house and its gardens.  His name appears a number of times in the Council minutes as he was the doorkeeper, and as he took out land patents. From Carter's letter to William Robertson 1727 July 15, in which he complains that "Mr. Hickman is very dilatory with his probatted Administrations," it seems that Hickman must have done other work for the colonial government. (Edward W. James.  "Libraries in Colonial Virginia."   <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 3[1,#4, Apr. 1895]:248-51 for Hickman's inventory recorded 1732 May 15  listing many books; "Notes from the Journal of the House of Burgesses, 1712-1726." <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title> 21[1,#4, April 1913]:257 mentions his being Council doorkeeper; "Notes from the Journal of the House of Burgesses, 1727-1734, <title>William and Mary Quarterly.</title>22[1, #1, July 1913]:54,56-58, mentions his being clerk of the Committee of Propositions and Grievances; and <cit><bibl n="B10">McIlwaine. <title>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</title>, 4[1721-1739]:114. </bibl></cit>)</note>

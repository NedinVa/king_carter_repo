<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Edward Tucker, July 5 and 29, 1723</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, July 5, 1723, to inform him that he has drawn a bill of exchange on him to the London slave traders, Francis Chamberlaye and Francis Sitwell. He reports several other bills, including one from John Wormeley for a cask of Tucker's brandy. He closes by noting that he hopes to send 10-12 hogsheads of tobacco on board Capt. Wilson's ship but has not heard whether there will be room for  them on board. In a lengthy post script dated July 29th, Carter notes that Capt. Wilson has been delayed by sickness, and that the weather has reduced the expectations of a good crop. He tells Tucker that the news of a prohibition of importation of stemmed tobacco into England has been confirmed in Virginia, and suggests that Tucker and the other English merchants will need to learn to "Cheat as fast as they [the Scots]," they may be able to survive. He is not sure how long this sad state of affairs will last because most Scots ships have not found cargoes other than tar this year because they arrived so  late.<lb/><lb/>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1723 July 4 -1724 June 11, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond.  There is a 19th-century copy of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</note><lb/>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. His usual return address, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Francis Chamberlayne may have been the wealthy grocer of London whose daughter Elizabeth married John Francis Fauquier, an official of the mint and director of the Bank of England, between 1694 and 1702.  Carter had in 1720 acted as one of the Virginia agents for these London slave traders in the sale of a cargo of slaves. (<cit><bibl>http://www.geocities.com/markfreemn/francis_fauquier.html

<note id="n2">[2] John Wormeley (1689-1727), a younger son of Ralph Wormeley (d.
1701) for whom Carter had been a trustee in John's youth. When his older brother, Ralph died in 1714, John inherited all of their father's considerable estate in Middlesex and York counties.</note>

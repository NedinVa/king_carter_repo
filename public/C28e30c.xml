<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Stark, May 30 and July 9, 1728</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, May 30, 1728, to report the arrival of goods and accounts, and to complain of certain of Stark's accounting methods. He informs Stark of several bills of exchange, and then seeks the merchant's support of the colony's effort to obtain repeal of the act prohibiting the importation of stemmed tobacco into Britain. In a lengthy post script dated July 9th, Carter encloses bill s of lading, complains of Stark's holding his tobacco too long before selling it, relates a misunderstanding over a "hamper" of claret, and orders some burgundy and champagne.</p>

The letter book has suffered some damage to the first page of the letter which is faded along its margins, and has some textual damage.</note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] Carter noted in his diary 1727 January 19 the arrival of the <hi rend="italics">Mazareen</hi> at his house and a visit from her captain, Richard Kelsick, four days earlier. </note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Martha</hi>  was commanded by a Captain Dunlop; see Carter to Richard Oswald &amp; Company 1729 August 11.</note>

<note id="n4">[4] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <hi rend="italics">Lucia.</hi> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</note>

<note id="n6">[6] The <hi rend="italics">John &amp; Betty</hi> was a Liverpool ship often carrying slaves owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.

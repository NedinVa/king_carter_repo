<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Samuel Russell commanded the <hi rend="italics">Princess Amelia,</hi> a ship owned by Edward Tucker. A Board of Customs, Port of Weymouth, report of 1736-38, shows that the ship was built "in the Rappahannock River in Virginia and that it was registered in Williamsburg in June 1720." In 1725, Giles Lawrence commanded the ship and carried staves and pitch as well as tobacco from Virginia. (<cit><bibl>Survey report 14500</bibl></cit> ; and <cit><bibl>Survey Report 9723 summarizing Exchexquer King's Remembrancer port books for Weymouth,  found in the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n2">[2] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco itself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect August 1, 1731.

<salute>Sir,</salute>

<p>In answer to yours of yesterday I begin with the <lb/>
<note n="JC1">Secretary's</note> Business. <note target="n1">Mr. Lord</note> of the 9th <add place="supralinear">Instant</add> tells me he had <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> of the Secre<corr resp="editor">[tar]</corr><add place="supralinear">ys </add><lb/>
<abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr> in their Parish Six <abbr expan="hogsheads">hhds</abbr> which you had told him he must accot <lb/>
to you for. I have given Will Rowing, who is now in my Sloop &mdash; <lb/>
particular orders to take in this <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr> if he can get it, however it will <lb/>
not be amiss if you spur on Lord to be <sic corr="careful">carefull</sic> in getting the <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr> on board <lb/>
the Sloop. Mr. Lord mistakes himself when he <sic corr="says">sayes</sic> he <sic corr="has">hath</sic> no List of the <lb/>
Secretary's <add place="supralinear">Fees,</add> I'm sure he or some of his Officers had the list from me. <lb/>
I sent away the List I had from the Secretary's Office soon after it came <lb/>
to my hands. It amounted to 3694 pounds of <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr>.</p>

<p>The Secretary between his Clerk &amp; the Sheriff meets with &mdash; <lb/>
very extraordinary usage, what his fees came to in 1729 you are no &mdash; <lb/>
Stranger to. Four <abbr expan="hogsheads">hhds</abbr> of his <sic corr="Tobacco">Tobaco</sic> <abbr expan="that">tht</abbr> were to be weighty &amp; to come<lb/>
from Minors, were not <sic corr="rolled">rowled</sic> when my Sloop called for them not <lb/>
<sic corr="until">till</sic> I went up a little before Christmass, &amp; they were very light at last <lb/>
how much of the Accot is paid I know not. If this Sloop misses of his <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo</abbr> <lb/>
I believe Mr Lord may expect a Call from the Secretary. This Rate of<lb/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
Management will hardly find him Paper &amp; Pens &amp; Ink for his <lb/>
office; he is to be here is <add resp="editor"> [<hi rend="italics">sic</hi>]</add> eight or ten <sic corr="days">dayes</sic> he will then consider <lb/>
what is proper for him to do.</p>

<p>I now come to my own Business. Your <note target="n2">Bill of <abbr expan="exchange">Exche</abbr></note> <lb/>
for eight pounds five shillings &amp; Eleven pence discharges the <abbr expan="Balance">Balla</abbr> <lb/>
of your Money Debt. Your <sic corr="balance">ballance</sic> in <abbr expan="Tobacco">Tobo.</abbr> Is 3901. <note target="n3">Sallard</note> <lb/>
accots to me for three thousand one hundred &amp; thirty eight, You <lb/>
<sic corr="Balance">Ballance</sic> the Rest by a long Bed Roll of Fees, many of them I &mdash; <lb/>
understand not You charge me with Orders for Fines I don't re= <lb/>
member I ever had two pence for all the Fines; some of them I am <lb/>
sure are not mine to pay. The Charge of Mrs. Newton's Power of <lb/>
Attorney for Reliquishment of her Dower <del>is none of mine</del> <add place="supralinear">lies not properly against me</add><lb/>
<del>to pay</del>; I never authorized such a thing nor will I take any &mdash; <lb/>
thing less than her Personal appearance at Court &amp; Private &mdash; <lb/>
Examination as you already know; fees for this I suppose I <lb/>
shall hear of hereafter; I pray you therefore to put the Saddle<lb/>
upon the Right Horse.</p>

<p>You mention something of a pair of Milstones I had &mdash;<lb/>
from <note target="n5">your Father</note>. I remember I had a pair of stones from <note target="n4">Turkey <lb/>
Cock hill</note> which was many Years before your Father died &amp; several<lb/>
years <add place="supralinear">after</add> I delivered them with his Consent, as far as I can collect<lb/>
the story, to <abbr expan="Captain">Cap.</abbr> <note target="n6">Richard Ball,</note> who claimed them as his. I &mdash; <lb/>
know Nothing more of them, If I had them you should be &mdash;<lb/>
welcome to them; which is the <sic corr="Needful">Needfull</sic> at present from

<note id="n2"> [2] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always  negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

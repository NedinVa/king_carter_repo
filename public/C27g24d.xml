<title>Letter from Robert Carter to John Falconar, July 24 and August 22, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant John Falconar, July 24 and August 22, 1727, to send bills of lading (not present) for tobacco of his own, the Burwell estate, and his grandson, Carter Burwell. He sends an invoice (not present) for goods, and notes that he has some debts which he intends to have paid into Falconar's hands "to answer all my Occasions." In a lengthy post script dated August 22, 1727, he sends a copy of the earlier invoice (not present),  an invoice for medicines (not present), an order on Micajah Perry for &pound;200 (not present), and a bill of lading (not present)  for 17 hogsheads of tobacco that he wishes sold promptly. He also orders some silver long promised to his daughter, Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell Nicholas, and tells Falconar that Mr. Pratt, his old friend, will assist in this purchase.  </p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] <note id="n">[] John Falconar (d. <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C27g24d.html">Carter's letter to Falconar </xref> of July 24 and August 22, 1727, for details about the payment of &pound;200 to him. (See <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C30d16b.html">Carter to William Dawkins,</xref> for Falconar's death date. <cit><bibl>Arthur Pierce Middleton. <title>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</title> Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</bibl></cit>)</note></note>

<note id="n2">[2] Captain James Hopkins commanded the <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> in 1727-1728. He was then working for London merchant Robert Cary. He is mentioned in Carter's diary. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] The <hi rend="italics">Marlborough</hi> was a vessel of 100 tons and 14 men, owned by John Falconar (as is noted in this letter), and commanded by George Buckeridge (Buckbridge). (<cit><bibl>Admiralty 68/195, abstracted in Survey Report 6801, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4]  Carter Burwell (1716-1756) was Robert Carter's grandson by his daughter Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721). Carter Burwell would live at "Carter's Grove," and would marry Lucy Grymes in 1738. (<cit><bibl n="B3">Carleton. <title>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 128.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n5">[5]  Clearing of goods imported into Britain involved paying the impost,  the duty imposed by Britain on imported tobacco, and obtaining the cocket (for which a fee was charged), a document bearing a cocket or seal issued by the "King's Customs House" that the impost had been paid. (See the definitions of each word in  <cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary Online.</title></bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n6">[6] A physick is a "medicinal substance; spec. a cathartic, a purgative. Also: medicines generally." (<cit><bibl><title>Oxford English Dictionary</title> online.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n7">[7] The <xref to="http://www.apothecaries.org/hall-hire/">Apothecaries Hall</xref> was  "destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, the Society immediately set about re-building the Hall. Work was completed in 1672 and an 'Elaborator'' was included for the first ever large-scale manufacture of drugs." </note>

<note id="n8">[8] Carter wants Falconar to avoid paying the impost or customs duty on this tobacco which was not liable if the tobacco was exported. </note>

<note id="n9">[9] A caudle cup was a "small, two-handled silver cup, usually with a cover, originally made in England during the second half of the 17th century and possibly used for caudle--warm ale or wine mixed with bread or gruel, eggs, sugar, and spices--which was administered to women after childbirth and to convalescents." (Encyclopedia Brittanica online, http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9021870/caudle-cup. 8/27/2007)</note>

<note id="n10">[10] John Pratt was a London merchant and an old friend of Carter's usually referred to him as "Daddy."</note>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to ]</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, September 17, 1723, complaining mildly of the poor tobacco sales the merchant has reported. He requests Stark find him a good barber surgeon either in Glasgow or Edinburgh, and adds later in the letter that he also needs a coachman, a carpenter, a blacksmith, a tailor, a brickmaker, and a bricklayer. He lets Stark know that a ship captain from another firm has solicited his business but that he will stay with Stark until he believes he is "Ill used."</p>

<note><hi rend="italics"><hi rend="bold">Source copy consulted:</hi></hi> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. </note>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</note>

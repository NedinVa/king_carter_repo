<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, May 12, 1732</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, May 12, 1732, reporting that he has received a number of letters and accounts. He is reasonably pleased with most tobacco sales, but complains about the price received for tobacco from Rippon Hall because it had had the reputation of bringing the very highest prices when Edmund Jenings owned it. There are some minor problems with Dawkins's accounting, and Carter reports tobacco shipments and the general belief in the colony that the year's production will be low.</p>

there were several hogsheads that were very mean tobacco however I most observe<lb/>
too that I had not <sic corr="shipped">shipt</sic> them <abbr expan="hogsheads">hhds.</abbr> if it had not been in Service to your<lb/>
Ship to fill her up at the importunity of John Graves. The Sale of the<lb/>

for it which I have kept ever since I was master of the Plantation<lb/>
however it came to be altered in <abbr expan="your">yr</abbr> account of sales</p>

<p>I find you have paid <note target="n7">Mr. Edwards's</note> bills of Exchange out of my money you<lb/>
should have noted the day of payment to me and have sent me in a protest against<lb/>
Mr. Edwards and that you had paid it upon my Accot</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] The <hi rend="italics">Bailey</hi> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732).

<note id="n2">[2] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck."

<note id="n6">[6] John Falconar (d. <hi rend="italics">ca.</hi> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price.

County that hath as much Mettle and more cunning for Contention then his predecessor had" Carter wrote

<note id="n16"> [16] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange.

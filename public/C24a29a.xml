<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas Colmore, January 29 and February 15, 1724</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchant Thomas Colmore, January 29 and February 15, 1724, reporting the arrival of Captain Wills's ship, and complaining about the merchant's sales of his and the Burwell estate's tobacco. He also complains of Colmore's method of preparing the account current that he sent to Carter. Mr. Pratt has kept his tobacco to be sent on Wills' ship, and he adds that he is sending some more Burwell estate tobacco to Colmore in the hope that he will receive better sales this time. In a post script dated 1724 February 15, Carter lets Colmore know that  the slaves' shoes the merchant has shipped were far too small for the sizes maked on them; "Your Shoomaker hath bin a Arrant Cheat." He orders 6 dozen pairs in large sizes to be shipped as soon as possible.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</note>

<note id="n1">[1] Thomas Colmore was a London merchant. (<cit><bibl>A 1740 London directory,<title> A Compleat Guide . . . ,</title> consulted by Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., in London, listed Colmore as a resident of Pudding Lane, Eastcheap.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n3">[3] This vessel was commanded by Captain Constantine Cant and may have been owned by William Dawkins and Micajah Perry as Carter reported her December 1723 arrival to each of them. (<cit><bibl>Adm. 68/194-195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</bibl></cit>)</note>

<note id="n4">[4] The Rappahannock.</note>

<note id="n5">[5] Louis Wright has speculated that Mr. Pratt might be William Pratt of Gloucester County as there were several Pratts active in Virginia at this time. In his <xref to="/users/berkeley/public/C20g13m.xml">letter</xref> to Micajah and Richard Perry written July, 13, 1720, Carter noted that "Mr. Pratt took care of those [letters] for James rivr &amp; York" which makes Wright's speculation as good as any.  (<cit><bibl n="B12">Wright. <title>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</title> p. 2.)</bibl></cit> </note>

<note id="n6">[6]  The <hi rend="italics">Bailey</hi> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. (<cit><bibl>Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</bibl></cit> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins <xref to="http://carter.lib.virginia.edu/html/C32e12b.html">May 12, 1732,</xref> refers to "your ship Bailey." as does a letter of August 10, 1733, from Carter's executors to Dawkins.

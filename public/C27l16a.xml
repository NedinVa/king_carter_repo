<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Cage, Esqr., December 16, 1727</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to William Cage, trustee for Thomas Lord Fairfax December 16, 1727, to inform him that Micajah Perry has written Carter that the Board of Trade has made a decision in the case of the proprietor's rights concerning the "interpretation of the Grant upon the fines and forfetures" and, while does not yet know what decision was reached, he assumes that it was sent to the colony by its attorney general, John Clayton who has just returned from England. He continues that he hopes that Perry has paid his rent for the proprietary for 1726 and that he has instructed Perry to do so, and to pay the current year through Michaelmas. The rent will have deducted from it money owed by the late Edmund Jenings to the proprietors which Carter had paid for him </p>

<p>It is a long time since I had the favour of a letter <lb/>from you <note n="MP2">Mr Perry</note> writes me your case about the interpretation of the Grant upon <lb/>the fines and forfetures was refered to the Attorney and Solicitor general who have <lb/>now give their Opinions differing in some points to their Opinions sent me some <lb/>Years ago and that the <note target="n1">Lords of trade</note> have determined thereupon and sent in their <lb/>instructions to <note n="WG">our <abbr expan="Governor">Govr:</abbr></note> by <note n="JC3">Mr. Clayton</note> our Attorney general lately returned from <lb/>England what these instructions are I do not yet hear Our Attorney has been a stre=<lb/>nuous Advocate for the king in this cause all along and I suspect hath been <lb/>a main instrument in getting the Lawyers to alter their Opinions for I am sure <lb/>they had the case nakedly before them when they gave their Opinions before I <lb/>have done my Utmost in this Affair if the <abbr expan="proprietors">proprs:</abbr> will <sic corr="sit">set</sic> still and suffer them<lb/>selves to be determined out of their rights one step after another without ever rising <lb/>up in defence of their own interest I must patiently <sic corr="sit">set</sic> down contented the da=<lb/>mage for my time will not be very great&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I Expect Mr Perry hath taken care to pay my rent <lb/>to you for the Year 26. there hath some Misunderstanding happened between <lb/>us of late however I have never wanted money Sufficient in his hands to ans=<lb/>wer this call and now for fear there may have been an Omission I send him a <lb/>positive order to pay you for that years rent and if you insist strenuously for <lb/>the rent of this present year to <note target="n2"><sic corr="Michaelmas">Michaelmass</sic></note> last to make payment of that <lb/>also deducting only the debt of <note n="EJ"><abbr expan="Colonel">Collo.</abbr> <sic corr="Jenings">Jennings</sic></note> of thirty Odd pounds which <lb/>plainly Appears to be <abbr expan="Overpaid">Overpd.</abbr> to me upon a just settlement beyond what was <lb/>due from him to you and by me paid to you for which I Stand chargeable here</p>

<p>I took a great deal of pains and was very Vigi=<lb/>lant in getting this money for you else you would have found it very hard to come <lb/>by never man left his Estate under greater confusion than that poor gentle=<lb/>man and I beleive his Creditors will fall short in getting their Debts above a <lb/>thousand if not two thousand pounds after Land and all is gone I hope for my <lb/>diligence you will think it proper not to let me be a Sufferer in any respect 

<pb n="2"/><lb/><lb/>
And in the punctual payment of my own rents I have hitherto given you no un<lb/>easiness please to give my humble service to <note n="TF">his Lordship</note> from whom and yourself <lb/>I should be glad to receive a line Yearly I am </p>

<title>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah and Richard Perry, July 22, 1720</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to London merchants, Micajah and Richard Perry, July 22, 1720, concerning bills of exchange and tobacco shipped on board the <hi rend="italics">Carter,</hi> including 9 hogsheads belonging to Daniel McCarty. He notes that he has received a report of sales they had sent with Capt. Friend, and that he is pleased with the price fetched. He turns to his son John's pleas of repentance about his spending and attention to his studies and states that he will not remonstrate further if John keeps to his promises. His debt from Edward Hastewell still disturbs him, and he hopes the Perrys will assist John Bashford. He concludes with a remark about the South Sea stock, Parliament's "Falling into a 
Design that Threatens ruin to the nation, " and that all things political are presently calm in the colony.</p>

<note>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for clarity.</note><lb/>

<note id="n1">[1] Edward Hastewell, a London merchant, had been one of the owners of  the <hi rend="italics">Carter</hi>.</note>

<note id="n2">[2] John Bashford (d. 1735) may have had problems, but in 1726, he was to present affidavits in Northumberland County court to prove his parentage and marriage because <q>he had fallen heir to an estate in England.</q> (<cit><bibl>"The Heaths of Northumberland County, Virginia,"  <title>William and Mary Quarterly,</title> 1st. ser., 24[1915]: 109-115.</bibl></cit>)</note>


<note id="n3">[3] RC refers to the South Sea Company whose stock in June 1720 was worth &pound;1060 for each &pound;100 share; the crash of the "Bubble" was underway even as he wrote. (<cit><bibl>Goldwin Smith, <title>A History of England,</title> p. 424.</bibl></cit>)</note>

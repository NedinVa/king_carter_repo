<title>Letter from Robert Carter to William Cage, Esq., July 19, 1725</title>
</bibl>
</head>
<p>Robert Carter writes to the trustee of the Fairfax estate, William Cage of County Kent, England, July 19, 1725, to summarize the state of the proprietor's affairs in the colony. His accounts from London merchant Micajah Perry show that the rents have been paid, and he complains that he is unable to obtain rents from land holders to equal that he pays. He has received the new lease for the Virginia agency and the terms are hard ones which he may be able to meet but that his executors will have difficulties with. With the letter he sends accounts (not present) that clearly show that the proprietor owes Edmund Jenings &pound;39 /14 and Jening's agent is in London to present them. The case in the colonial courts in which the proprietor is claiming certains fees and fines is moving very slowly to be summarized for presentation to the Board of Trade, and he notes a new cause that Cage and Lord Fairfax may wish him to pursue: there has been a suicide and Carter believes the guilty man's goods belong to the proprietor. He closes with a complaint that Cage seldom writes.</p>

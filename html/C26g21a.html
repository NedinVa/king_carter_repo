He believes that the Northern Neck case has been carried to England by the colony's attorney general. He notes that his receipts of quit rents from the Northern Neck propietary come in very slowly, and he hopes that Cage will not press for the lease rent each year. And he hopes that Cage will allow him credit for money that Edmund Jenings overpaid to the proprietors, and which Jenings has withheld from payments due Carter. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">William Cage,</a> July 21, 1726</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa[hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>July the 21st: 1726<br><br>William Cage Esqr:<br> <br>Sr -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry I have not bin so much in yor: <br>favr: to receive one Line from you this year, <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr. Perry</a> <br>indeed tells me he had  promisd  you to  Solicite  the Stated case <br>of the Northern Neck at the board of trade, but that it was <br>not sent thither by our <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Govr:</a> who hath bin in a very ill <br>State of health for a great while, which probably may <br>have bin the Occasion of this Omission <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr. Clayton</a> the <br> Atturney  General went for England in one of our forward <br>Ships I suppose he may have Carried it with him, Mr. Perry <br>hath Sent me your receipt for &pound;420"-"-pd: you in March <br>last, my rent for the year, 1725 Altho this money hath bin <br>so long paid from me, I have not yet rec'd the Sixth part of it <br>which I hope will be a moving Argument to you, to be as <br>patient as possible in Allowing me all the time you can <br>for the paying my rents in, The Mmerchants by keeping my <br>Tobbo. year after year unsold have laid me under difficu=<br>-lties I have not bin used to before, -- </p>	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Letter dated July the 19th: 1725 I sent <br>you a Clear Acct: of your Case with <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Coll Jennings,</a> in <br>which it appears plainly he overpaid you by my hands <br>Thirty nine pounds fourteen Shill, this money he Stop[s]</i></font></sup> <br>from me as a paymt: from him being Considerably in <br>my debt, and I had hopes to receive orders from you about <br>it, that I might be  allowd  to pay you so much Short of <br>my rent, which I think is but a reasonable proposal <br>I make my request to you now to have recourse to my <br>Letter and Acct: I sent you and that you will allow this <br>money to be discounted out of my next years rent</p><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been  informd  your Affairs  Cheifly lye  in <br>the Country, that you are not fond of the  fateigues  of the Town <br>however I cannot refrain desireing you will please to <br>allow me the favour to have a Letter from you one a year <br>at least, My humblist Service I desire may be presented <br>to his <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Lordship</a> I am </p><br><u>Sr</u> <br>Yor: most  Faithfull Obedt:  <br>humble Servant --  <br><br><i><hi rend="bold"><i>ROBERT CARTER</i></i></b></i><br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b>  Fairfax Papers, BR 227,  folder 34, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California.

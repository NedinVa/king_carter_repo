The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] There  were several vessels with this name. One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726/27. Carter's letters mention a Captain Brackhill in 1728, and Captain Loxum in 1733. ( Adm. 68/194, ff.30, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] James Christian was captain of the <i>Rose,</i> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] The words "to be Copyd" were added in the hand of a different clerk than the one who wrote the body of the letter.</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Mary</i> was a London ship of 130 tons commanded by James Hopkins, and owned by merchant Robert Cary. ( Admiralty 68/194,ff. 82r, abstracted in Survey Report 6801, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] The <i>John &amp; Betty</i> was a Liverpool ship often carrying slaves owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.

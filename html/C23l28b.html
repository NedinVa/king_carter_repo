Colonel George Mason and Robert Alexander applied to Carter first and were given warrants which makes it impossible for him to give Broadwater a warrant in that area. He also lets Hooper know that he expects Hooper to write more often, and to pay more attention to making surveys for Carter's own land entries.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to Captain <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#TH">[Thomas] Hooper,</a> December 28, 1723</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Decr: 28th: 1723<br><br>Capt: Hooper<br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Yours of the 3d: of Decr: just now came to me <a href=#n1>Col: <br>Mason</a> writ to me a great whle since and I have past <br>a Warrant for the <a href=#n2>Dooges Land</a> to him which I cannot <br>recall so that <a href=#n3>Mr Broad Water</a> must thank You for <br>his disapointment in keeping his Entry in Your pocket <br>and neaver giving me any account of it Yesterday <br>I  pass'd  two Warrants for three Thousand Acres Each <br>one on the upper side of great Hunting Creek the other <br>on Pimmets Run between the Lands of <a href=#n4>Col: Lee</a> and <br>Mr. Scot I am  affrid  this Letter will affect Mr Broad <br>waters second Entry however I have sent him a Warrant <br>accordng to his bounds believing that may best please <br>him should I send him a Warrant for the Land Col: <br>Mason hath already one for it would be in my estate <br>but picking his pocket if after Masons four hundred Acres <br>is laid off there be any Land left Broad Water has a mind <br>to let him signify it to Me and I will take care to <br>reserve it for him which is the greatest Kindness <br>I can now do for him</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are very short Me thinks in your writing <br>Sure You have other Subjects enough to entertain me <br>with.

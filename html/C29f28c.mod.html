<br>June 28th. 1729<br><br>
Mr: Wm: Dawkins<br>
 


<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  received   yours  of the 25th: of November
 by the <a href=#n1> Bailey </a><br>
 with  the goods for the Maintainance of the Children<br>
&amp; their Estate amounting to &pound;40:11:0 and the  Account <br>
 Current  to the 1st: of  August  1728. the Ballance at that time<br>
28:14:8. the 8 hogsheads of Tobacco by the <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Carter </a> still to be accounted<br>
ed for, and <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Colonel  Carters </a>bill of 7:6:0 still to be  charged <br>
so that  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>   out of</i> the produce of the unsold Tobacco  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S> <br>
 <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>   is to come</i> &pound;20:17:0 the Remainder to be  placed <br>
to  your   Credit   against  <a href=#n2>Isaac Lees</a> bond as  per  our order. We now<br>
send you a bill of lading for 9 hogsheads Tobacco more in the<br>
Bailey, and upon it draw a bill to  Colonel  Carter for 10:7:10<br>
and also send for a parcel of goods as few as It's possible<br>
 to maintain the slaves with</i>  which : we  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  reckon will not come  to</i> with charges above 16&pound;<br>
the remaining part of the Effects of this Tobacco we Desire<br>
you will place to Isaac Lees  Credit  against his bond<br>
	Herein we send you 2 bills of Exchange one drawn<br>
by  Colonel  Carter on  your self for 5:9:0 the other by Philip<br>
Smith on  John  Berry &amp;  Company  for 8:1:0 these sums we<br>
also pay on Discharge of Isaac Lees Debt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2 small bills we sent you last year you tell us <br>
were  placed  to Isaac Lees  Credit  but hope you are not to be<br>
paid in this small way, That Isaac's Estate ought to<br>
be sold; You are to know that this Estate under our<br>
government belongs to the rest of the Children as well<br>
as to Isaac, their part they are they are under no Obligation<br>
to sell, we keep it all together until we raise the<br>
mony for the Discharge of  your  debt  &amp; this they  acquiese  in</i> if there was a <br>
Division perhaps 2 or 3 Negroes might fall to his <br>
share, the rest would be Cattle &amp; Hoggs wch: will not<br>
fetch mony, by keeping the Estate together you will<br>
be paid in time, &amp; if you will be so  Rigorous  your<br>
bond will give you Interest until you are paid, Therefore<br>
we think it best for you as well  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  as for the Children, to <br>
keep the Estate working together until you have  your  mon [ey] <br>
we hope you will not be dissatisfied with this method<br>
after these bills are come to hand &amp; this Tobacco sold we<br>
would have a stated  Account  how much of  your  bond remains<br>
unpaid. we are
</p>

<br> Your   <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  most humble  servants

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members.

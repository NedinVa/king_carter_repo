Carter adds that he and Gawin Corbin drew a bill of exchange on the merchant for some of the estate's quit rents, and that he will write later with instructions about the balance of the estate's funds in the merchant's hands.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to an Unidentified Recipient, August 20, 1706</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>  [Rappahannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br> [August 20, 1706]</i> <br>Sr. <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor declining all manner of business that Small part of Esquire <br><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#RW">Wormely</a> designed you is with others  varied   into other hands <br>This only intended to give you advice that <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#GC1"> Colonel   Corbin</a> &amp; my  <br>Self Sometime Since drew on you for &pound;23:15:2  payable   to <br>the proprietors of the Northern Neck being for <a href=#n1> Quit   rents</a> <br>due from Land belonging to the <a href=#n2>Orphans</a> wch must desire <br>you to pay &amp; Debit that Estate wth it  I have   not time to say <br>more at present hereafter I purpose to be particular <br>relating to the  Ballance   of that Estate in yor hands I remain at present  Sir  <br><br>yor humble Servant  </p><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted:</i>  Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County, Processioners' Returns, 1711-1783, and Wormeley Estate Papers, 1701-1710, 1716, Acc. 30126, Archives Research Services, Library of Virginia, Richmond, 170.</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The return address,county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded, undated letter.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</a><br><br><a name="n2">2[] Carter often referred to in their youth as his "Cozns." or as the "Orphans"  Ralph Wormeley (<i>ca.</i> 1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley (1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father's will.</a><br><br><br><i>This text revised July 22, 2008.</i></a> </BODY></HTML>

<br><br><a name="n15">[15] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</a>

<br><br><a name="n16">[16] Richard Haynes was master of one of Carter's sloops. (See Carter to Richard Meeks, 1729 June 30.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n19">[19] Old House Quarter was located in Christ Church Parish, Lancaster County, and was inherited by Carter from his brother. The name may refer to the original Carter settlement in the county.

Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B30">Greene.  <i>The Diary of Colonel Landon Carter. . . .</i> </a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n23">[23] John Falconar was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell would form an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The associaton lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</a>)</a> 

<br><br><a name="n24">[24] There was a ferry over the Piankatank River near Berkeley Island operated by Bailey Seaton that Carter often refers to when describing trips to Williamsburg. There is a Seaton property noted on the Fry-Jefferson map on the Piankatank River in Gloucester County. </a>

<br><br><a name="n26">[26] William Waugh (d. 1726) was an important overseer for Carter until his death in January 1726; he seems to have been in charge of Jackson's mill as well.</a>

<br><br><a name="n27">[27] Although Carter had  an extensive collection of law books, none fits his description of "Turnrs Letters." (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#A28">Wright. "The Literary Interests of the First Carters." </a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n28">[28] Charles Carter (1707-1764) was Robert Carter's tenth child; his mother was Carter's second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis Carter. Charles would live at "Cleve," King George County, and inherit a number of properties in that area from his father.

<br><br><a name="n29">[29] John Wormeley (1689-1727), a younger son of Ralph Wormeley (d.
1701) for whom Carter had been a trustee in John's youth. When his older brother, Ralph died in 1714, John inherited all of their father's considerable estate in Middlesex and York counties. (<i>See </i> "Letters Concerning The Estate of Ralph Wormeley" in the opening page of this web site.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n30">[30] Ragged Point was a Westmoreland County farm probably located near the point of the same name. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B29">Miller.  <i>Place-Names . . . . </i> p. 131.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n31">[31] A James Bryan was listed as a resident of St. Mary's White Chapel Parish of Lancaster County in the 1716 tithable survey of the county. Carter agreed 1725 July 2 with a James Bryan "Brickmaker" for the production of  200,000 bricks. ( "Tithables in Lancaster Co., 1716."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly</i>  1st. ser., 21(July 1912): 111;</a>and Carter diary, 1725 July 2.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n32">[32] A puncheon is a cask or barrel; John Tully was a cooper, a skilled tradesman who could produce barrels of various sizes. </a>

<br><br><a name="n33">[33] This was probably Barnabas Burch "the boatbuildr" with whom Carter had had problems before causing him to describe Burch as "an idle Roug ever Since he came here  the work he has don hath not answerd" in his diary entry for 1725 February 2. In June of that year, Carter learned that Burch and several others had stolen a gun and hidden it in the woods.

<br><br><a name="n114">[114] Carter may have been attempting to spell "tow" in his usual idiosyncratic phonetic way. "Tow is coarse flax (linen) material made with the short fibers of flax left in the hetchel, or combing device. It is a type of cloth that would have been woven on any plantation that was producing flax, as tow is a good way to use up the by-products of linen production."

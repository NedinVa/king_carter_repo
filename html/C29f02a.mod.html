<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being Arrived at the years of Infirmity <br>Wherein I may too  truly  say I have little Pleasure I <br>am forced to do the most of my business with Pen and Ink</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place I shall congratulat [e]  <br>you upon Several Accots upon your <a href=#n1>safe arrival</a> into  [your] <br> <S><font color="red">Own Country</font></S>  Upon the recovery of your health and p [ar] <br>ticularly upon your Success in being the Happy man  [in]  <br>bringing back the olive branch of Liberty ag [ain to us]  <br>which for some years  has  <S><font color="red">been</font></S>    been</i>   [<i>sic</i>]</i> like chains about  [our]  <br>necks to restrain us from  modeling  our Vital Comod [ity into] <br>such shapes  that renderd it most agreeable to the market  [and]  <br>most Advantageous to the Masters For this Vaulable<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n2>Service</a>

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br>
deservedly meet with the <br>generous thanks of your country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My law=suit with <a href=#n3>Allerton</a> is <br>of no great value and yet I would <br>not loose it upon any account if <br>I could help it. Their endeavour=<br>=ing to weaken my title under the <br>Properitor's grant without setting <br>up any title under the person <br>who last <u> died </u> seized I can see no <br>manner of reason for: nor can I <br>think the Court will allow <br>them, or ought to do it, to insist upon <br>this part of their argument. How=<br>=ever I hope you will arm your=<br>=self with all your strength to bat=<br>=ter them out of this part of their <br>hold. The papers I have at home <br>with me and shall send them to <br>you as soon as you shall think it <br>requisite.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the passing of some Patents <br>in the Little Fork of the Rappahannock <br>which is plainly within the bounds <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[of the Northern

of the Northern Neck, by <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JH">Mr. Hol=<br>=loway</a>, I entered a <a href=#n4>caveat;</a> and I <br>left it as my desire to him to <br>tell you as soon as you arrived. <br>I depended upon you as my lawyer <br>in the cause. He promised me not <br>to forget it and  <S><font color="red">told me</font></S>  withall <br>told me from your being engaged in <br>defending the Properitors Grant <br>before he believed you reckon your=<br>=self engaged to be for me now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a suit at Law in eject=<br>=ment brought against a tenant of<br>of   [<i>sic</i>]</i> <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr. Burwell's</a> in King George, <br>by  Captain  <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#LCF">Henry Fitzhugh,</a> in which <br>Mr. Holloway is engaged and I <br>reckon upon you  also. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Holloway drew the caveat for <br>the Properietors,  has  all the pa=<br>=pers and will let you into the <br>whole of the case. The Orders of <br>Council made in it I suppose he <br> has   also. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[I have a

I have a great desire to see <br>you; and if I can get well enough <br>in a fortnight or three weeks time <br>to undergo the fatigue I  propose  <br>to make a trip to York &amp; thence <br>to <a href=#n5>Town,</a> unless I can luckily <br>meet you at <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1"> Colonel  Page's.</a> </p>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> The Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond, still includes the first page of the draft of this letter which bears some damage along its right margin. The other pages of it have disappeared since the 19th-century copyist had access to the letter book, and the rest of the letter text has been prepared from the copyist's transcript in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. A note has been provided to show where the copy texts change.</a>

<br><br>The letter book's first page of the draft bears neither date nor address. The date is tentatively assigned because this letter follows another of this date in the letter book. Carter's usual return address of "Corotoman" for letters sent to persons in Virginia, and the county and colony, have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Randolph had recently returned from a trip to England where he had acted as the colony's agent in working for the removal of a Parliamentary act prohibiting the shipping of stripped tobacco; his mission was successful.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The letter book text ends with the word "Service."</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Willoughby Allerton (1664-1724) was a prominent citizen of Westmoreland County where he was burgess, sheriff, and militia officer.  ( Allerton Genealogical Data at http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~edburton/fam03055.htm, 4/16/04;</a> and <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</i> , 3[1705-1721]: 92,146,381,420. </a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] A caveat is a  "formal notice filed with a court or officer to suspend a proceeding until filer is given a hearing . . .  a warning against certain acts." ( "Meaning of CAVEAT." hyperdictionary. http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary.</a>)</a>

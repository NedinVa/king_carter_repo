CaptKelsick and understanding from him that you had sold<br>
some of my 30 hogsheads of tobo sent  yo  in the  Mazareen  last year<br>
when he came away I have nothing to add to that matter in that matter only to<br>
wish you may meet with a good Market for them
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein you have a bill of Loading for 20:<br>
hogsheads of tobo more in the same Ship consign'd to  yo  for sale<br>
Resting in hopes that both this and the last Parcel may return a<br>
living price I am,
 
</p>

<br>Gentlemen,<br>
Your very humble servant,

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Peter How was a merchant of Whitehaven on the Irish sea in northwest England, who, with Richard Kelsick, traded with the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area from the early 18th century. "He had interests in coal and iron-ore mines and set up an iron-working forge at Low Mill in 1750. Debts incurred by the forge and the decline in the tobacco trade may have contributed to his bankruptcy in 1763. "  (" Fredericksburg and Whitehaven Connection to English port a forgotten chapter in area's Colonial history Living-history program," http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2005/072005/07022005/111483/palm,, 2/22/2006; and Notes on a portrait of  "Mrs Peter How and her Two Children, Peter and Christian,"  http://www.artfund.org/acq/artworkDetail4_5.asp?appref=2247, 2/22/2006. )

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter noted in his diary 1727 January 19 the arrival of the <i>Mazareen
</i> at his house and a visit from her captain, Richard Kelsick, four days earlier.

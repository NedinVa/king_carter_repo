what security you  pleas  upon your sales for the Security of yr.<br>payments but be your methods what it will Our ruin depends upon <br>the effect of an incautious trust this is a melancholly

hope he has not the power to ruin the rest of his fathers Child= <br>ren and I desire and  begg  of you that you will not let him take his <br>Swing in any immoderate manner and I am sure tis  in your power to restrain <br>him from having any more money than you see reasonable to let him have <br>if he spends his own after he gets it into his possession he must then thank <br>himself but before he has that power in himself there ought to be an Accot <br>Settled and a division made if this is to be the Effects of an English Education <br>I don't know who will venture their Sons

of his time at the univer= <br>sity and would be a Comfort to his relations here when they come to see <br>him and that he would without fail come to Virginia this next Ship= <br>ping I have  writ  Year after Year for his Coming in and have  writ  to <br>him many monitory letters with the tenderness of a father but he turns <br>his back upon me and where he has his manners I know not Certainly <br>the University affords better or else I had rather breed a Son in a dark corner <br>of the Earth he hath not vouchsaf'd a line to me now these two years and <br>when I had one I should be very angry with a son of mine if he could not <br>have afforded me a better at 14 years of Age Perhaps I may be carried <br>into more warmth than is  intirely  prudent however I shall again repeat <br>my Solicitations to you to send him to Virginia as soon as possibly yo. <br>can and in the mean time not to let him lavish out money that is none of his <br>own And if you will indulge him beyond what's proper the fault will not <br> lye  at my door  twas  propos'd at his going to the University to allow him <br>&pound;150 a year and no more all that he spends beyond that I am sure had <br>better be hove into the Sea The keeping that Estate together and the <br>making the most of it has cost me abundance of Care and trouble and <br>I have a very Affectionate Memory for the  worthyness  of his dear father <br>Pray God Grant him that he may imitate him in prudence and also <br>other manly Virtues I am <br></p><br>Sr. <br>Your most humble Servant <br><br>via   Leverpoole   <a

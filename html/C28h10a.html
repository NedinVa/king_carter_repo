<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Captain James Hopkins commanded the <i>Mary</i> in 1727-1728. He was then working for London merchant Robert Cary. He is mentioned in Carter's diary.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The 140 ton <i>Welcome</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on 1727 May 17.  John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728.

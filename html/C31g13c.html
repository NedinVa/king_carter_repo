 Corotomon, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br>
<br>13 July 1731<br><br>
Wm Howeis &amp; <br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have understood you have both behaved your selves in<br>
a very  Villanous  &amp; base Manner; not like such Servants as you are  -- <br>
by your Indentures, tht is Diggers in the Mines. I have therefore thought it <br>
proper to send to <a href=#n2>Mr Grayson</a> Copies of your Indentures, that he may know <br>
tht you are our Servants for four years from the Time of your Arrival into the<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countrey 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
 Countrey;  &amp; that, if you do not know how to behave your Selves as Servants,  -- <br>
that he should make you do it by Correction suitable to your Deserts. And to<br>
that End I do hereby let you know that I do appoint him your Master in <br>
the Absence of Me or of my sons, giving him the same Power over  [[you]]  tht we have<br>
you pretend to  Holidayes  &amp; what not; but I forbid it you &amp; order him to<br>
make you work  dayly,  as the Rest of my servants tht are there do day by day,<br>
keeping no more  Holidayes  on <sup><font color="green">non</i></font></sup>  Saturdayes  in the afternoon than they do  --  <br>
It seems one of you (Haweis) is a very  prophane  Rogue, curses his<br>
Meat &amp; us that are his Masters. I order Mr Grayson not to let you have so <br>
much Meat as you have had. And, seeing you have abused the Kindness you <br>
have met with, to treat you in a worse manner than you have been, &amp; <br>
give you sound <a href=#n3>Drubbings</a> suitable to your Merits. You shall know you <br>
have Masters tht will not be fooled by You, but will use the proper way, <br>
with you to bring you to better Manners.</p>

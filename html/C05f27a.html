New York Colonial Administrative Records, Series #A1894, Vol. 51, 41a-c. This document was copied for Governor Francis Nicholson's private papers, and was carried by him to New York when he later became governor of that colony. The papers remained in New York, passing into the custody of the State Library which burned around the turn of the twentieth century, causing some damage to this series of records. These records have been transferred to the state archives, and there are several copies of this document in the series. </a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Lightfoot (d. 1707) of New Kent County had been born in England, and was appointed to the Council in 1692. <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B7">Tinling.  <i>The Correspondence of the Three William Byrds. . . .</i>  p. 129.</a></a><br><br><br><i>This text revised July 1, 2008.</i></a>      </BODY></HTML>

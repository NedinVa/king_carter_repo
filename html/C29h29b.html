<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capt Ireland of your Port from James riv<br>
er Came  hither  seeking freight I made a Possitive agreemt. with <br>
him for Forty hogsheads he pretends he could not meet with a Sloop big eno:<br>
ugh so I have got but 25 in him the rest of my Tobo is left <br>
Herein comes a bill of Lading for 20 hogsheads of my own Concern You <br>
will have the accot from all parts of the Abundance of rains <br>
that we have had this Summer all along many of the lowlands <br>
quite drowned all great Sufferers the high lands Tobacco will be <br>
very thin and light we reckon in General the Crops this year <br>
will be very much Short of the last Which gives us hope Even the tobo <br>
 allready  gone will meet with a Much better market than the last did <br>
the Liberty of Stemming for which we have now an <a href=#n1>Act of parliamt</a>

Quantity as well as mending the Quality</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you Can meet with an Early ship to let my goods <br>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

He informs the merchant that he wishes to be involved without his name being connected with it in another case that will be appealed from the judgment of the General Court in Virginia to England. The case was brought by a wealthy "Esqr. Hallow's," who lives near Liverpool against the heirs of Manley in Virginia. Carter recused himself from sitting on the case because he had bought an estate from Manley, and reports that Edmund Jenings's vote carried it before the council even though he is so old and infirm that he really does not know what he is voting on. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WD">William Dawkins,</a> November 29, 1723</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Novr 29th. 1723<br><br>Mr Willm.

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The <i>Content</i> was a Liverpool ship owned by John Pemberton and commanded by various masters including captains Stephenson (1721and later) , Fowler (1723), and Morton (1727). (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B12">Wright.  <i>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</i>  pp. 92, 93, 102</a>; and Carter to Pemberton, 1721 February 14, and 1727 June 28. )</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</a>

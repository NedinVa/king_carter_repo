Haswell &amp; Brooks, May 29, 1732, to report the arrival of letters and goods from them. He complains that a shipment of coal is a very small quantity, and about the merchants having deducted  a half penny on a tobacco sale because of poor stemming. A bill of lading (not present) for a tobacco shipment is enclosed, and wine that they have ordered for him has arrived so they should expect a bill from the wine merchant.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>Messrs.

" The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al. </i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. </i> </a> pp. 236-39.)</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Christopher Brooks commanded the  <i>Cambridge,</i>  a vessel of 100 tons and 11 men owned by London merchants Haswell and Brooks.

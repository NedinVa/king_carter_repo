<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  <i>The Independent Whig</i>  was a "a weekly political sheet" first published in January 1720 and continued for a year by Thomas Gordon and John Trenchard. This material was later gathered together with other writings and published by Gordon as a book, and it may be that book that Carter wanted.

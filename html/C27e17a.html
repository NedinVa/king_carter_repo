He was disappointed with the sales of his tobacco, but notes that they were about what he had received from others. He is sending tobacco on board the <i>Providence</i> and he sends a bill of exchange for the duties. He reminds Bradley that he wishes to find a place for his son Landon as an apprentice to   learn the Virginia trade, and hopes that Bradley will change his mind about taking Landon.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>James Bradley,</a> May 17, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa[hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>May 17th 1727<br><br>Mr. James Bradley<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor: Ship  Welcome  is arrived but lately Mr. <br>Trice was with me the other day and is in pretty good hopes he shall <br>be able to do his business	I have promised to Assist all I can but <br>cannot do much had he bin an Early ship his business would <br>have bin easy</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have rec'd your Several Letters and the Sales of my <br>Tobbo: which was very low however it keeping pace with my <br>other Accots: I must be Contented In hopes the next will do better <br>It was all my own Crops and you may Easily Conjecture  wee  <br>cannot live by these prices the most  wee  can make per head ha[r]</i></font></sup><br>dly amounts to a hhd.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now sent you in the  Providence  <a href=#n3>Capt: <br>Woodward</a> 10 hhds: of my Sweet Scented crop Tobbo.

The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in this letter, Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,</i> but little information about Bradley has been located.</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The 140 ton <i>Welcome</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley as Carter notes here. John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1727.

Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary.

Hendrick.  <i>The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family.</i>  [Boston: Little Brown, 1935]. pp. 48, 51, etc.</a>)</a><br><br><a name="n6">[6] Francis Lightfoot had been naval officer for the upper district of James River until his death; a new officer was appointed in February 1727.

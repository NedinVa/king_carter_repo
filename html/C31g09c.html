<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Content</i> was a Liverpool ship owned by John Pemberton and commanded by various masters including captains Stephenson (1721and later) , Fowler (1723), and Morton (1727). (<a href="Cbibl.html#B12">Wright.  <i>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</i>  pp. 92, 93, 102</a>; and Carter to Pemberton, 1721 February 14, and 1727 June 28. )</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] This may have been James Tarleton who in 1731 cammanded the <i>The Loyalty</i>. Several vessels with this name sailed to Virginia. One commanded by Francis Wallis cleared from Poole for Virginia in 1726. Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel of this name in 1729-1730.. (Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter's letters to John Pemberton 1730 April 15 and 1731 August 4.)</a>

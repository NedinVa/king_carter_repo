</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

</i> was a London ship owned by merchant Robert Cary and commanded by Thomas Price. (See Carter to Samuel Smith, January 22, 1728.)

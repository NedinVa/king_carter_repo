</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Captain [Thomas] Hooper, December 28, 1723, chastising his friend and business associate for his failure to notify him that Captain Charles Broadwater wanted land on Dogue Run. Colonel George Mason and Robert Alexander applied to Carter first and were given warrants which makes it impossible for him to give Broadwater a warrant in that area. He also lets Hooper know that he expects Hooper to write more often, and to pay more attention to making surveys for Carter's own land entries.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] This probably is present Dogue Creek in Fairfax County, lying along the southwestern side of what was once called Mt. Vernon Neck, near Mt. Vernon. "Dogue Creek is a tidal tributary of the Potomac River in Fairfax County, Virginia, named for the Doeg Indians." ( Alexandria Drafting Company.  <i>Regional Northern Virginia.

</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] "Hunting Creek is a cove and tributary stream of the Potomac River between the City of Alexandria and Fairfax County in Virginia. It is formed by the confluence of Cameron Run and Hoof's Run. The community of Huntington takes its name from the creek. Jones Point forms the north side. Dyke Marsh is just to the south. George Washington Memorial Parkway crosses it on a bridge. The creek is sometimes referred to as Great Hunting Creek, to distinguish it from Little Hunting Creek."  It appears on the Fry-Jefferson map of 1751. ( Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_Creek. 12/9/2010

</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] Pimmits Run is located in today's Fairfax County, and Wikipedia's description of its meandering route is good:  [It] "runs from Fairfax County to the Potomac River at Chain Bridge in the Arlingwood neighborhood of Arlington County." There is a neighborhood and a park bearing the Pimmits name along its route. Wikipedia also notes, "The stream was named for John Pimmit who in 1675 was an overseer for William Fitzhugh (1651-1701). John was naturalized a citizen in 1679, and died by drowning in 1688-1689. He was survived by three children." It is also stated that a citation was needed for this information. It almost certainly was taken from Fairfax Harrison's <a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William,
</i>

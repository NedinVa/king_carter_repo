<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, September 10, 1731, to cover a bill of lading (not present) for tobacco, and commenting that tobacco has been harvested but the corn crop is ordinary. He orders a pair of Cologne millstones for a mill he is building at Rippon Hall, and reminds Perry of his earlier orderes for Madeira and pipe tobacco. He has read Perry's "friendly" letter to Judith (Carter) Page, and hopes that the "Irish stockings" he has ordered for the Page "people" will arrive before winter.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

</i> in 1723-1724, and the <i>Amity,
</i> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary for June 1723.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. ( "Notes and Queries."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  received  yours of the 16th  Current  and with my<br>
answer shall follow it in Order I did not tax you with any ill man<br>
ners to my self but your letter to my son which I had I think<br>
has none good in it your Stuffing my Peoples with  poisonous <br>
 drugs  that you got here in the Country and giving them un<br>
warrantable Potions that cost you Nothing but your own<br>
invention without any Authority from your Physick books<br>
which you Pretend to be very well versed in I am ready to

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
prove to your face not only by the Evidence of <a href="Cbiodir.html#RM">Mr Meeks</a> and his<br>
wife but Other ways  Also  You load Meeks with a great many<br>
envious detracting epithets which I know he is not Guilty of<br>
And as for your neglect to come to my sick people when sent<br>
for very frequently many times when your have been in your Airs<br>
many days together is to be  proved  not only by Mr Meeks and<br>
his wife but I believe most of the Overseers I have</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find you are very angry that I should think it <br>
Proper after such usage to give you a discharge from my bus<br>
iness which at other times I am wrongly  informed  if you have<br>
not spoke of with Contempt as for the Ostentation of your<br>
Character I shall not meddle with leaving it to your own breast to<br>
 please  your self as much with the thoughts of it as you <S><font color="red">r own ap</font></S>   think fit</i><br>
 <S><font color="red">illegible will give you</font></S>  And shall only  wish</i> for your own sake it  <S><font color="red">were</font></S>   runs</i><br>
 <S><font color="red">more Current Com</font></S>   more smoothly</i> Among those that know you</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have been very kind in helping me to the<br>
first letter I sent you upon coming into my business which<br>
makes out in what manner you were to take care of my fami:<br>
lys I am sure you will not pretend that you have  complied <br>
with the terms of this letter I  believe  you have not visited my<br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#CP">Coles Point</a> Plantation above two or three times if so Often<br>
since you have been in my business and it will  lie  upon<br>
you to prove that I came to any other Agreement with you You<br>
have been so far from following the terms of this letter that I<br>
 believe  if a true  Account  were made of the times of sending to you<br>
you have never some to my People upon one half   <S><font color="red">of the messages</font></S> </i> if not two thirds<br>
of the messages you have had  and several of my slaves have died wch you never saw in their sickness</i> I have been very kind to you  paid

debts I have now your  obligation</i> for &pound;25 sterling dated some years  ago <br>
let you have Considerable quantities of corn almost yearly that<br>
never  [were]  Charged to your  Accoont  these and other kindnesses should<br>
be  returned  with gratitude from a generous mind and not An:<br>
swered with a dark  innuendo  of my Usage to you When you come<br>
to give me a visit You will do well to prepare yourself  with <br>
a great deal of good humour which will be the only way to<br>
make you a welcome guest to your

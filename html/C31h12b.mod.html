 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry &amp; Company, August 12, 1731</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry &amp; Company, August 12, 1731, concerning his grandson, Lewis Burwell, then a student at the University of Cambridge. As Burwell has ignored his advice, Carter will not bother him further, but asks Perry to reduce his expenses.</p>

 Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>Augst 12. 1731<br><br>
Alderman Perry<br>
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already been very particular <br>
upon every Subject only have omitted saying anything of <a href=#n1>Lewis<br>
Burwell</a> since the 15th. of April since which I have  received  a letter<br>
from him dated the 25. of January from <a href=#n2> Caius   College </a> he is the<br>
writer of it but I daresay the matter is  owing  to the invention of a=<br>
nother it is a frothy  piece  of Stuff in  Justification  of his disobedience<br>
to my order he talks as if he intended to stay two years at the University<br>
it is in Vain for me to lay any new injunctions upon him.  the only<br>
restrictions that I can impose must arise from your treatment of him<br>
by a bridging   [<i>sic</i>]</i> his Expences I can only repeat what I have already said to  you <br>
in relation to him to Which I desire you will  please  to be  referred.  I<br>
write to him by this conveniency  but it is with Expectations that he<br>
will take as little notice of what I say now as he did before if he runs<br>
into any destructive courses the Effects of them will turn upon himself<br>
I have done the duty of a Parent by him.  I shall mix nothing else here<br>
with but am Sir 
</p>

<br> Your  most humble Servant

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a 19th-century transcript of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Lewis Burwell (1711 or 1712-1756), Carter's grandson by Elizabeth Carter Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721); Carter was his guardian. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and inherited considerable property, living at "Fairfield," Gloucester County. He would be president of the Council in 1750-1751.

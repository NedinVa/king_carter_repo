SinceGale advises him not to send more tobacco there and to use hisbalance, he has drawn a bill to Edmund Jenings. He mentions a debtpaid to Micajah Perry on his behalf, and concludes with comments ontobacco prices at Bristol and in Holland.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>JohnGale,</a> July 13, 1720</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa[hannock, LancasterCounty, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>July 13th. 1720<br><br>Mr. Jno.

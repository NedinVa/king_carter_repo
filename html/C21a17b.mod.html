He asks the Perrys to persuade Lord Fairfax and Colonel Cage to enter a correspondence with him regarding the affairs of the propriety, and to attempt to have these men bring influence on the Crown to direct the governor of Virginia to be friendly to the proprietary's affairs. He needs a much stronger "power" concerning the granting of lands from the proprietary, and directs the Perrys to obtain one for him similar to the one he had had from Lady Fairfax when he had been agent before.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP">Micajah Perry Sr.</a> and <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Jr.,</a>January 17, 1721</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]   <br><br> January   17. 1720/21<br><br>Messrs.

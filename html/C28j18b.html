 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to [Robert Jones, October 18, 1728]</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Prince William County  resident [Robert Jones, October 18, 1728], to give his manager instructions about the care of hogs, the handling of corn, butter, and hides, construction at the new town of Falmouth, and the use of nails in adding laths to the slave cabins on the plantations under Jones's charge. He expresses the need to keep the slaves warm in the winter because it will mean fewer fatalities.</p>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. This date has been tentatively assigned because the letters immediately following it in the letter book were written in mid-October 1728. The earlier page or pages of this letter book are missing, and the pages on which this draft was written have lost material along their edges as well as a large section that is missing on one side.</a>

<br><br>This letter was published in <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#A8">Berkeley. "Robert Carter as Agricultural Administrator: . . .", 273-295.</a></a>

<br><br>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft. </a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Murrain are the hides of animals that have died either naturally or from diseases.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] William Threalkill is mentioned in the inventory of Carter's estate as the overseer at Poplar Quarter, Stafford County. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#A26">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."</a>.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Fork Quarter was a farm in Richmond County that would become a part of the "Sabine Hall" estate as it was bequeated to Landon Carter. In 1732, William Galloway, the overseer, supervised 16 slaves, 42 hogs, and 54 cattle. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#A26">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] John Hust (or Hurst) was the overseer of "Hamstead Quarter," Stafford County, in the 1732 inventory, supervising  sixteen slaves with the assistance of one horse. Hust apparently was a carpenter because Carter mentions his doing carpentry work in various letters. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#A26">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The new town of Falmouth was created by the Assembly in February 1727. Carter, Mann Page, Nicholas Smith, William Thornton, John Fitzhugh, Charles Carter, and Henry Fitzhugh the younger were the "directors and trustees." The land chosen for the site of the new town lay in King George County, and deeds would have been recorded in its court records.  ( William Waller Hening,  <i>The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of the Laws of Virginia . . . . </i> [Richmond, 1820. reprint, 1969]. IV, 234-39.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6]  "In 1724, Robert Carter took out patents for, among others: the Licking Run tract of 10,227 acres which lay along and east of Licking Run above Germantown and across Owl and Turkey Runs, to what was then supposed to be the western boundary of the vast Brent Town Tract. Here Carter seated the Lodge Quarter mentioned in his will."  Timothy Dargan was its overseer in 1732. ( Carl F. Cannon, Jr., "Robert ("King") Carter of "Corotoman." Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Duke University, 1956, p. 274;</a> and <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#A26">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] The word "reave" meant to rob or strip at Carter's time. Pehaps he meant that the overseers would prepare the laths for nailing onto the walls of the slave quarters.</a>

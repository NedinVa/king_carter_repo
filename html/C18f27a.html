</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Robert Burridge, a merchant in LymeRegis, Dorset, England, on June 27, 1718, reporting a draft onBurridge to John Parker, and reminding Burridge that he had askedCarter to buy some tobacco for him. Now he has written to Cartercomplaining about the high prices in Virginia for tobacco, and Carternotes "Indeed there hath been no such time produced the like withinmy memory." The Scots merchants are buying up "most ordinary, meaneststuff in the country " at these extraordinary prices. Cartercontinues that he has not had the opportunity of shipping tobacco toBurridge this year but will next if a Lyme ship presents itself. Heasks Burridge to pressure his brother John (a London merchant andmember of Parliament) to account to Carter for 9 hogheads sent him 2years earlier. He concludes that Burridge complains at length aboutDaniel McCarty who, in turn, complains about Burridge. He does notknow where the truth is, but hopes "you may be so much friends toyour own peace to compromise your differences among yourselves," and counsels that theonly ones who gain in lawsuits are the lawyers.

In one of your's this year you <br>advise me topurchase you some Tobo <br>upon bills. In another you  controul <br>yourself upon the news you hadof the <br>high prices given here.  Indeed there <br> hath   been no such timeproduced <br>the likewithin my  memory.  21, <br>22, 23, 24 &amp; 25 <a href=#n1>p Ct 
</a>  hath  been <br>given thisyear for Tobo. The most <br>ordinary, meanest stuff in the country <br> hath   sold at theseprices and the <br>Scotch are still laying up all the refuse <br>and trash they can meet with. what the<br> misterie  of their trade is I don't <br>know; but sure I am were we to give <br>these prices for suchgoods we should <br>never see our principal by a great deal.

</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brother <a href=#n3>John
</a>, the <siccorr="Parliament">Paria=<br>ment [sic]  man, stands in my debt for <br>nine Hhds of Tobo I sent him two<br>years ago -- would never yet let me <br>know what he sold it for. I am <br>very sorry there issuch a flaw in <br>the reputation of one of your  family. <br> Methinks  you shouldbe so much <br>concernedat it as to attempt everything <br>in your power to bring him into the <br>humour of doing me justice:and <br>pray interest yourself so much at <br>least in my behalf to get an accot <br>what is become of mygoods. I <br>find 'tis  in vain for meto write <br>to him. You'll do your family but <br>a credit to bestiryourself so <br>effectually that I may have my money.

</center><br><br> can by no means set your horses <br>together.  You complainmightily <br>against him and he is as big with <br>complaints of you.  Who is in the <br>wrong I can't tell.One story is <br>always good till another is heard. <br>I wish you may be so much <br>friends toyour own peace to <br>compromise your differences  among <br>yourselves.  Few get so much in the<br>end in going into contentions of <br>Law, set aside the Lawyers and <br>Officers. But this is noneof my <br>business.

</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained.
</a> <br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.

</a>  <br><br><a name="n2">[2] Burridge was located in Lyme Regis, Dorset.
</a>  <br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Burridge (1681?-1753), brother of Robert, wasa merchant in London trading primarily "to Guinea and the West Indies." It is not surprising thatRC could not obtain the sales report and money he mentions in this letter; in 1717, John Burridge'sestate had been seized by the Crown for non-payment of duties  on wine. John Burridge represented Lyme inParliament from 1710-1728. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B6">Sedgwick.  <i>TheHistory of Parliament . . . Commons.

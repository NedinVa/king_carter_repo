<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ale you sent me proves very good. I had <br>
a prodigious damage in that which Came in the hamp:<br>
ers. I must for the future desire what I have to be  packed  into <br>

safer way</p>

bill of Lading for 10  hogsheads  of  Tobacco

plantations it is all to one  hogsheads 
 that 20 odd hands made <br>
there are some  hogsheads  of it that are  Stripped  to promiscuously <br>
into <a href=#n2> Lugs. </a> I chose it as the better way to Avoid Shipping the <br>
 <S><font color="red">Crop</font></S>  trash and I think I can demonstrate that it is provide [d]   <br>
people are  Careful  when we had the liberty of stemming <br>
before We used to manage our under  tobacco 
 this Way and I never <br>
 failed  to have less than a 1/2 and 3/4 more for it a pound than <br>
for the best leaf</p>

could send me in good digger that hath been a Worker in the Copper <br>
mines and knows how to follow a Vein under Ground it <br>
will be of a great Service to us by the many signs we have met with &amp; <br>
the  Trials  we have made we have Certainly found a  piece  of ground <br>
That has Copper  <S><font color="red">mines</font></S>  in it We have been at a Great deal of Charge <br>
already and have  raised  some small parcels  of very good ore</i> but for want of men <br>

 lie  in the Way of  Your  business to procure us men fit for our work <br>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. That address as well as the  county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

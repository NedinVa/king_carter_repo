<br>Gentlemen<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th. Instant I own the receipt of your <br>

</a>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since <a href=#n2>Mr Cheap
</a>  has  been at my house and I have <br>
 discoursed  him plentifully about the manner of  your  Making up your Accot <br>
Your raising your Commission upon the long Customs in my thoughts is not <br>
right the first 1   pence  indeed by act of Parliament is to be paid Down but the <br>
rest of the Duty which is never paid by the  merchant  that sells to Export I think <br>
we ought not to be  Charged  with commission upon further than the Charge of <br>
the bond that the  merchant  gives for it. I  Produced  to Mr. Cheap Several Accots <br>
from other  Merchants  where the long dutys were not  Carryied  to the Credit side <br>
 [Mr.]  Cheap coming home I shall refer  myself  to the discourse I had <br>
 [with him]  upon this Subject.

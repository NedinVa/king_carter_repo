 Corotom[an],  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>June 12 1729<br><br>
Colo Thos Lee<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your favour of the 26th of may I shall now Answer <br>
According to your own method. I proposed to take  your  Cash at the same <br>
rate the  Receiver General  does  the Kings</i> his  Rights and so I am ready to do he did me <br>
the Favour to make me a visit not long since and then told me his way <br>
is when he receives Cash to take 3/4 d  upon  <S><font color="red">the</font></S> </i>  every pound to make it sterling <br>
and this shall  satisfy  me either in Silver or gold According to the Curr [en] ce <br>
or if it will suit as well with your  Convenience  to give me a bill I shall <br>
be Contented to take a Scotch one rather than fail and make you the <br>
same Allowance the  Receiver general  does<br>
	your After reasoning About the 11 Acres is soft and<br>
Cool  [damage]   breaks  the bone in strict right I cannot<br>
be convinced but my son should have them and your Warrant will<br>
be  complied  with verbatim however if the prejudice will be so much<br>
to you as you Conceive and so little to the Advantage of my son if you<br>
don't like it let it be as you desire it and let my son be  served <br>
as you would please him we will have no longer Controversy about<br>
it</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect to your rents you must Certainly be in the <br>
wrong  [el] se minor hath  deceived  me in the Stafford rent roles<br>
Mr Carter Differs with  your  Accot but 41 Acres you paid nothing<br>
 [damage]  minors Accot of what he receiv'd  for  your  Staffd land</i> he gives me Credit but<br>
 [damage]  62 Acres for one year so that According to your own Account <br>
 [damage] hat According to  your  own Accot here is 2844 Acres not Paid for<br>
which is justly my due Either from you or Minor And I believe you<br>
will not dispute there is more than 3  [damage]  years due to me upon<br>
youir last deeds</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will Allow me to put you in remembrance<br>


<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
In your last Naval Offrs. Accot you Settled with me as <a href=#n2>Pre=<br>
sident</a> there was a  balance  in my favour of 19/ If I mist=<br>
ake not if which I suppose your Accot will inform you of</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will be at the trouble it will be easy wth<br>
Minor to settle this Accot of your Stafford lands as it Ought<br>
to be I am<br><br>
</p>

<br>Sir<br>
your Most Humble servant

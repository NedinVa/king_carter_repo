 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, May 21, 1730</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, proprietor of the Northern Neck, May 21, 1730, concerning a lease Fairfax has given Bristol merchants, noting that he had encouraged them but told them it would be some time before Fairfax would receive any profits from their venture. He turns to the attempt he and his family are mking to exploit signs of copper, but notes their discouragement. He understands that Fairfax will consult with Michajah Perry about defending the boundaries of the proprietary, and a new lease of it for Carter. The reports of iron mining are not to be relied upon because the cost of transporting the ore is very high. He turns to attacks  in the colony upon the proprietary, noting that there may be action when the Assembly meets soon since there have already been attempts to change the boundaries.</p>

The Rt.. Honorable<br>
the Lord Fairfax -- 
 
<br>My Lord<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honour you did me in a letter of the 9th of Novr<br>last did not reach my hands 'till the 9th of March. in it you are<br>pleas'd to acquaint me with the  Leas  you had transacted with some<br>Bristol Merchts and to desire me to permit them to work unmolested from<br>whence I conjecture they had given yr Lordship information of some<br> desturbance  I had  threatned  them with if they have said any thing of<br>this nature to your Lordship 'tis a very wrong charge I was so far<br>from discouraging that I encourag'd them all I could in their design. One<br>of their partners here Offer'd to compound with me for your Lordship['s]</i></font></sup><br>share to whom I answer'd their Adventures would be carry'd on to so<br>little purpose in my time that I should not concern myself about it any<br>further than to wish them a great deal of success and when I saw your<br>Lordships  leas  which was shew'd me by <a href=#n1>Colo Tayloe</a> one of their part=<br>ners I told him I was glad that your Lordship had made such a<br>favourable step to their design but I believe twill be a great While before<br>any benefit by this  leas  will arise to your Lordship the Undertakers<br>have made very little progress yet and have not sent in [in] </i></font></sup>this Shipp<br>[i]</i></font></sup>ng any people  skilld  in the Affair to carry on their business and as<br>I am told are under a great deal of discouragements and have sent for<br>home their chief Workman whom they sent in on purpose for this design<br>to give them an Accot of his  discoverys  which have turn'd to very little<br>yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my letter to your Lordship of the 24th of June<br>last  amongst  many other things I gave you an Account of this place<br>where the Bristol men are upon and also of another that had some<br> shews  of Copper this other place  lyes  high up Potomack and far from<br>water some others of my family with myself have been at considerable<br>charge already to find out what this place will  yeild  but to little purpose<br>hitherto in our first searches we met with some veins of ore amounting to<br>some few  tonnes  which we are now Sending, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --  -- <br>

to make a  tryal  of what Value they are but as we went deeper the<br>veins grew less and instead of increasing our hopes we are very doubt=<br> full  we may never find out any Considerable body of ore Worth our<br>While however we intend to push on our  Tryals  a Little further what<br>I tell this Story to your Lordship for is that we are in hopes as your<br>Ldship hath gone into a  leas  with the Bristol Men to give encourag=<br>ement to these designs so you will  Pleas   to come into the same measures<br>with us in favour of our design if ever We Can bring it to Anything</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latter part of your  Lordships  letter you Acquaint<br>me that When <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. Perry</a> return'd to London you should pursue such<br>Measures in relation to your boundaries as Should Appear most  prope[r]</i></font></sup><br>Mr Perry writes to me to the same purpose and as to the renewing of my<br> leas  you had promis'd to do it after his return from the Bath from whence<br>I have reason to Conclude these matters are effected before  this time</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Lordship tells me you expected  some proposals abo[u]</i></font></sup>t<br>the Iron Works I cannot see how any Advantage can be made to<br>yr. Lordship from them Works the ore  lyes  near the Surface of the earth<br>they buy it for little or nothing from the Owners of the Land I have been<br>Several times at the place my self they  rais  it with very little  trouble<br>or Charge their great chuarge is in Carting it down about 9 miles to<br>a landing and from thence Water bearing it about 40 more to their<br>furnace now what advantage it will be to  yr  Lordship or anybody<br>under you to demand apart  [<i>sic</i>]</i></font></sup> of this ore where 'tis  dugg  I  cant  con=<br>jecture</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now to acquaint your Ldship of a fresh Attack<br>is lately made against yr Grant who have been the Springs of it<br>I shall not take upon me to Say but there are now grievances sent<br>from the inhabitants of most of the  Countys  within your grant com<br>plaining of the hardships they are under by it and desiring that the<br>King may be  addresst  either to purchase or reassume the Grant that<br>they may be under the same circumstances that the rest of the Country<br>are

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br>

What these complaints may be  Workt  up to in our Assembly which  sits<br>down to day I  cant  pretend to tell I have already told yr Lordship what<br>potent enemies our revenue gentlemen were against the boundaries<br>&amp;ca. and there's no Doubt to be made but their utmost strength will be<br>imploy'd in Carrying this Complaint to the highest Pitch their<br>fingers itch to have this grant added to their places and I have rea=<br>son to think that these disturbances have much encourag'd the inha<br>bitants to be very backward in paying their rents  altho  I am forc'd<br>to take them in tobo and that not to be sold now for 3 S per hundr'd<br>for I never had so few of the rents receiv'd at this time of year before<br>Since I have been in the business</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my own part in my justification I can say<br>I have made no Alteration in anything relating to the Execution<br>of the Grant nor is anything done but What is Very  justifyable   undr <br>it I observe the same measures in all my demands as I have done<br>ever since I was concern'd and as the  rist  of the agents before me did</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember about the year 1695. (as I think) such<br>a [hole in leaf]</i></font></sup> Struggle was made by greivances to an Assembly [ag=]</i></font></sup><br>ainst the grant and the then house of Burgesses joyn'd in a[n]</i></font></sup><br>Address to the king, to purchase or reassume, it was carry'd to the<br> Council where it was  Stopt  and went no further Sir Edmund Andros<br>was then our governour. I have thought it necessary to lay these things<br>before yr. Lordship that your Lordship may be 'fore  Apprized  and enter<br>upon such measures yr Ldship may think most proper for your secu=<br>
rity to Extricate yourself and those that are imploy'd under you here out<br>of the sd. difficulties I am

He sets out problems with the land encroaching upon that for which Francis Awbrey already has warrants, and other problems with lands desired by Mason. He reminds Mason that he remains interested in land offered for sale by John Mercer provided Mason will sell him an adjoining piece.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to Colonel <a href=#n1>George Mason,</a> November 10, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Novr. the 10th: 1727<br><br>Colonel George Mason -- <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Sorry I was not at home when you were at <br>my house but you ought to thank your Self you might Justly reckon <br>my duty then obliged my Attendance on the general Court.

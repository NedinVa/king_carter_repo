He reports bills ofexchange drawn against the estate's accounts for Dr. Belfield's andRichard Meeks' (the overseer) salaries as well as one of his own forhis use of four slaves on his lands, and some miscellaneous expenses.He comments that the estate's poor lands make it difficult to producesufficient income, and that the estate's slave cooper is a "Bunglerat the Trade" and the tobacco shipping casks are poor. He closes byasking the Perrys to remember the trouble he has had managing theestate's affairs if they should "find It necessary to give up Yor.Interest in That Affair." </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Micajah</a> andRichard Perry, July 14, 1720</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [LancasterCounty, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>July 14th. 1720-<br><br>Messrs.

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added forclarity.

</i>1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley(1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father'swill.

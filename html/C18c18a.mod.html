</b>                1718-03-18     <br> Source copy consulted: Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- now lost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and  "corrections"  obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained.                         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared for the University of Virginia Library Electronic Text Center.

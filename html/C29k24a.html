<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I writ to you from <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Colo. Pages
</a> with him to desire yo [ur] <br>
paymt. of some money to Ms Ravenscroft for nine thousand weight of Tob <br>
we had bought of him in Gloucester and that our Bills should be ready for <br>
you upon demand this affair I suppose may be accomodated by this time
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After my coming home my Son <a href="Cbiodir.html#RC2">Robert
</a> acquainted<br>
me you had made him an Offer of <a href=#n1>Hallowss
</a> Land and <sup><font color="green">told him
</i>
</font>
</sup> that you were <br>
fully impowerd to Sell it when I went from home I had it in my thought [s]  <br>
to   <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S>  <sup><font color="green">have
</i>
</font>
</sup> treated with you very particularly about this  <S><font color="red">Business
</font>
</S>  <sup><font color="green">matter
</i>
</font>
</sup> but what  thro  <br>
your  multyplicty  of Business the difficulty of having any conversatio [n]  <br>
with you and to say truth my own forgetfulness it never came into my head <br>
 Till  Robins  <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S>  discourse Mr. Hallows in a letter of the 16th: of Decr: <br>
last (for you must know we have been in treaty about this Land for man [y]  <br>
years) tells me  <S><font color="red">that illegible
</font>
</S>   among other things that upon your return from <br>
the Bath he had seen you and intended to Invest you with the property of the <br>
lands to Enable to you to  <S><font color="red">grant
</font>
</S>  make good the title and therefore advised me to clo [se]  <br>
with you upon your return that he had rather the Estate should fall  <S><font color="red">as
</font>
</S>  to my <br>
share with whom he has <sup><font color="green">had
</i>
</font>
</sup> some Correspondence  <S><font color="red">rather
</font>
</S>  than to a Stranger and <br>
that my Friend <a href="Cbiodir.html#JP">Mr Pemberton
</a> Will be ready to Observe my orders &amp; <br>
 <S><font color="red">would pay the
</font>
</S>  that he might have his money upon the first return answ [er] <br>
ing me that he will  ratifye  and Confirm the Title upon the receipt of the <br>
Purchase money these are some of his Words and I cant but think he may <br>
have said something like this to you however it Came to pass that not a <br>
Word should arise Between you &amp; I Concerning this Letter I must own <br>
the plaice is very covt. to some of my Sons Lands and he seems  pritty  fond of <br>
having it and therefore If <sup><font color="green">yo.
</i>
</font>
</sup> think it Proper to give me the refusal of it and <br>
Will contrive a place of meeting (but that I would Willingly have at my house <br>
which you may take in your Way up as my Son tells me you are design'd) <br>
if you are not too Stiff in your demands I shall be ready to Close the Barga [in]  <br>
According to Mr Hallows Phrase Yr Answer hereto is desired by Sir yr most

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Samuel Hallows (Hallowes) was a great nephew of John Hallowes, an early landholder in Northumberland and later, Westmoreland County, who was usually identified as of "Nomini" in Westmoreland County. Samuel Hallows lived in Ashworth, County Lancaster, England. The tract in which Carter was interested may have been that of 2400 acres acquired from Hallowes in 1733 by Thomas Lee.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#GT"> Captain  Turbervile</a> being here I cannot have a better Oppor<br>tunity to answer a part of your last Letter I must own I was  disatisfied  <br>with <a href=#n2>Thomas</a> for his large Survey for you Exceeding so much the <br>Quantity of Land the warrant was for. first for that I had given him <br>positive Orders against Such a Practice and next that it is the very land <br>he had proposed to take up for one of my Descendants and I  believe  had <br>a  warrant  in his pocket for it at the time when he made your Survey <br>not that I intended to Stop a Deed to you upon the Survey which has <br>bin drawn a Considerable time and is registerd. As to your Picking <br>and heaving out all the bad land I can never agree to Such a method <br>upon  payment  of your  Composition which if in  Tobacco  I have made it a <br>rule to my Collectors not to take unless in hogsheads of 700 neat and  [...]  <br>Convenient too, If you have a mind to pay Sterling money I am <br>Contented to take 10/ per hundred Acres which is the Price the rights <br>are Set at by the Crown upon your  payment  either ways your Deed Shall <br>be Sent to you I am </p>

<br>Sir<br>Your  most humble Servt

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Gale was a Glasgow merchant about whom has little been discovered. Carter would write him several times in the period 1727-1729.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</a>

Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments.

After Governor Hugh Drysdale's death, the Council appointed him to manage the Governor's house and its gardens.  His name appears a number of times in the Council minutes as he was the doorkeeper, and as he took out land patents. From Carter's letter to William Robertson 1727 July 15, in which he complains that "Mr. Hickman is very dilatory with his probatted Administrations," it seems that Hickman must have done other work for the colonial government.

"Libraries in Colonial Virginia."    <i>William and Mary Quarterly.</i>  3[1,#4, Apr. 1895]:248-51 for Hickman's inventory recorded 1732 May 15  listing many books; "Notes from the Journal of the House of Burgesses, 1712-1726."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.</i>  21[1,#4, April 1913]:257 mentions his being Council doorkeeper; "Notes from the Journal of the House of Burgesses, 1727-1734,  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.</i> 22[1, #1, July 1913]:54,56-58, mentions his being clerk of the Committee of Propositions and Grievances; and <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B10">McIlwaine.  <i>Executive Journals of the Council. . . .</i> , 4[1721-1739]:114. </a>)</a> </BODY></HTML>

</center><br><br><i>Source copy consulted: 
</i>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg,Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts. Asthey are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections"obviously supplied by the copiest have been retained. The copistused rows of the letter "x" to indicate material that he did not copyfrom the letter book.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and colony have beenadded for clarity on this unheaded letter.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter refers to the struggle between the Whigsand the Tories which brought the Whigs to power in 1715, and resultedin a contest between factions of the Whigs for supremacy. Sir RobertWalpole and Viscount Townshend led one faction, and the earls ofStanhope and Sunderland led the other.

 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah and Richard Perry, July
27, 1720</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants Micajah and Richard
Perry, July 27, 1720, informing them of the numerous bills of
exchange he has received from the sale of a cargo of slaves and which
are being sent on board the <i>Mercury.</i> He has
endorsed the bills to the owners of the slaves, Francis Chamberlayne
and Francis Sitwell, and he instructs the Perrys to pay any protested
bills from his account with them, returning any protested bills to
him. He concludes, "I hope You will Cheerfully undergo this Trouble
on my Accot." </p>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>
<br><br><i>Source copy consulted:</i>  Robert Carter
Letter Book, 1720 July-1721 July, BR 227, Huntington Library, Art
Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. Printed:

</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of
"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than
"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially
to merchants abroad. The county and state have been added for
clarity. This draft is entirely in RC's hand as the use of italics
indicates. The two postscripts are in a clerk's hand and are in the
left margin of the letter book.</a><br>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1 ] Francis Chamberlayne may have
been the wealthy grocer of London whose daughter Elizabeth married
John Francis Fauquier, an official of the mint and director of the
Bank of England, between 1694 and 1702.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" but as  Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, the overseer Carter refers to here must have been the local one for  the specific Burwell property. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11.   <i>Virginia Tax Records.</i>  [Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, Inc., 1983.] p. 539.</a>)</a> 

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] John Warner was the surveyor of King George County in 1727; he laid off the town of Falmouth in 1728. Later he worked for Lord Fairfax, and prepared an important map of his holdings.

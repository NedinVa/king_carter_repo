He orders new ones that are not tobe black because black shoes rot very quickly. He promises to sendsome tobacco to King but complains that Bristol prices are low andfreight rates high, and he reports a bill of exchange he has given toCharles Burgess. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JK">John King,</a>February 14, 1721</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [LancasterCounty, Virginia]   <br><br> February   14th.1720/21<br><br>Mr. John King<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a Short line to let You know I have <br>receivedYour  Goods by  Captain   Sweets Ship, The cider   pleases me <br>well enough, Your Shoos the worst that Ever Ihad from Your  <br>City I pray You to take the First opportunity toSend me 6  dozen   <br>more of the best plainsYou can buy, two  dozen   of the 16s. <br>2 dozen  . of the 14s. and 2 <abbrexpan="dozen ">doz of the 12s. and  let  them not be <br>madeof black leather which all these are, they always <br>prove rotten Iused to have the best  shoes   from <nametype="city">Bristol  <br>of any port in  <abbrexpan="England">Engd. </p>	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your   market   is very low and Freightsrun high <br>there is butlittle  encouragement   to Ship anyTobacco  to Your  <br>parts however I intend You Some If I can procure a <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>reasonable Freight,</p>	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew on You in  September   for&pound;15"14" --  to <notetarget="n1"> Charles  <abbrexpan="Burgess ">Burgs.</a><br>which  I desire You to pay, am Sorry my Tobacco  in Darracot Stuck so<br>long in hand, my hopes were Its going so Early It would<br>have come to an Early  market.

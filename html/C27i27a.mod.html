There should be tobacco to load the ship for the return voyage.  He also quotes the governor concerning the capture of seven ships by a Spanish privateer.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">John Pemberton,</a> September 27, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>Sepr. the 27th 1727<br><br>Mr. John Pemberton<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last went by <a href=#n1> Captain  Tarleton</a> Dated the <br>16th: Instant then advised the Arrival of the Rose <a href=#n2> Captain  Christian</a><br> <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  I have not time now to Copy Think it necessary to send <br>you this line Via Glasgow to advise how far the Sale is  gone  <br>forward That you be  apprised  in time how to order your  Affairs in <br>my hands Some of the bills of Exchange are not to be give [n]</i> me <br> until   April  I was glad to take them then Perhaps I may be able <br>to return you about Nine hundred pound by the Ship money <br>is become prodigious Scarce among us I have been  forced  to <br>take  Tobacco  for a great many as you will See by the  Enclosed  <br>list of the Sale there remains Six and Twenty unsold one of them <br>Just dead half the rest Sick  ashore  with Scurvys Lameness <br>Swellings and  other</i> disorders those that are  on</i> board the refuse most <br>if not all of them must go for  Tobacco  I shall now Consider the <br>Circumstances of Freighting the Ship there will be  Tobacco  enough <br>due this year  near</i> to Load her all to be of mens own Crops and <br>made heavy I make it all payable the Tenth of next month <br>and yet you know the  getting  our Commodity ready depends<br>ing so much upon weather there is no trusting to it therefore I <br>have thought it  advisable  to take Freight at &pound;8 per  Ton  <br>whether to let any more I am at a loss to determine I know you <br>have as much of your Concern home as you Could and yet I am <br>willing to Save your paying Dead Freight as much as possible <br>Your Charter Party does not Say whether your owners are to fitt <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>the Craft for the fetching this  Tobacco  or <br>the Freighters but I   but I must not agree to that if I can help it <br>the Freight  Tobacco  will be Consignd to you,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am  dooubtful  my proceeding in this Affair <br>hardly met with your Approbation however I have done my <br>utmost to Serve you as much as if the Concern had been my own <br>had it been so I could not have taken more pains the money of <br>the Country is quite Exhausted  we  have had above five thous<br>and Negroes imported this year I am told they Sell at York <br>the Choice of their Ships at &pound;35 &pound;31 per pair I hear <a href=#n3>Colonel Tayloe</a> <br>makes but an indifferent hand of it in Maryland His noats <br>are up  here</i> at Several publick places for the  letting  of freight at <br>&pound;8 per  Ton  Sterling If his Ship is to Load here I reckon  we  Shall <br>be in better Circumstances for a dispatch than he will</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall Send you a  piece  of News I had from the <br> Governor  Yesterday in his own words ("A Spanish privateer has <br>taken Seven Sail on this Coast Vizt: Captain Graham belonging <br>to London from James river Cockram of Glasgow from Patap<br>ses a  Liverpool  Ship from Maryland and a Sloop belonging to <br>Drummond of Accomack A Sloop of new York one of Am<br>boy and another of Boston which last they discharged with <br>the prisoners who are Arrived at Hampton I am </p><br>Sir<br>Yor: very humble Servt:<br><br>per Nicholson<br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad.

He gives John instructions about dealing with the "perquisites" or salary due him as acting govenor before Hugh Drysdale arrived, and for dealing with a small debt.

</a><br><br> The county and colony have been added for clarity to "Corotoman," the name of Carter's home.
</a><br><br>The last paragraph of the letter is in a different hand than the first paragraph. It was added to the letterbook after the letter to William Camp of the same date as it was written around the date and address of that draft letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1"> [1]  Richard Hickman (d. 1732) had been deputy clerk of Middlesex County in 1709. After Governor Hugh Drysdale's death, the Council appointed him to manage the Governor's house and its gardens.  His name appears a number of times in the Council minutes as he was the doorkeeper, and as he took out land patents. From Carter's letter to William Robertson 1727 July 15, in which he complains that "Mr. Hickman is very dilatory with his probatted Administrations," it seems that Hickman must have done other work for the colonial government.

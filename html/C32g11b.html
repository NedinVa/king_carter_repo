Because these two letters were written one below the other on the same page of the letter book with nearly identical texts, they have been entered together. See Carter's letter (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-carter?id=C32g11e.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/web/data/users/berkeley&tag=public" target="_wblank"></a>) to Micajah Perry of this same date in which he includes an account of what Hyde owes him as well as instructions for Perry's actions in the matter.</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel named the <i> Loyalty</i>in 1729-1730.

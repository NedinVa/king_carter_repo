</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son-in-law, Mann Page, July 3, 1727, to report that he has met with George Nicholas, husband of his daughter, Elizabeth, to settle accounts due Nicholas from the estate of Elizabeth's first husband, Nathaniel Burwell, for the years 1722 and 1723. (Carter and Page were the administrators of the Burwell estate.) With the assistance of Thomas Edwards, he has decided that Nicholas is due over &pound;367, for which he has drawn bills of exchange which Page must sign. He has sent orders for goods for the estate and the Burwell children. He concludes with affectionate good wishes to Page and his family. In a post script dated July 15th he tells Page that Nicholas also claims part of the  profits of the mill at Carter's Creek for which Carter has not given him an answer.

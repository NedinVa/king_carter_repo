He complainsthat he has not had a letter from Dawkins since April and hopes thatthe shoes he has ordered will arrive "before the frost Setts in hardupon us." Dawkins' report of his sales of 66 hogsheads of Carter'stobacco has arrived, and Carter notes that it probably was the lastbatch Dawkins will be able to sell at such prices. He resolves tosend Dawkins "none but nice goods," and requests that Dawkins givehis blessings to his sons Robert and Charles, then studying inEngland. He concludes by reporting that Dick Lee has been very illbut is recovering.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">WilliamDawkins,</a> September 19,1720</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [LancasterCounty, Virginia]   <br> September  19th. 17<hirend="underline">20</i></b> <br>Mr.  William   Dawkins<br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time I hope the <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Carter</a> is safe at<br>her  moorings   &amp; tht.

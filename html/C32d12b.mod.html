The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] This vessel was commanded by Captain Constantine Cant and may have been owned by William Dawkins and Micajah Perry as Carter reported her December 1723 arrival to each of them.

" The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al. </i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. </i> </a> pp. 236-39.)</a> </BODY></HTML>

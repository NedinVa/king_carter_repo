Mr Edwd Athaws<br>
 


<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your remembrance of the 26th of  Decembr <br>
came by <a href=#n1>Graves
</a> who Arriv'd about three Weeks ago the best answer I<br>
can give it is to tell you that the states of my tobo and the and the  [<i>sic
</i>]
</i>
</font>
</sup>  prizes <br>
of my goods give me a moderate Satisfaction. the markets were so low<br>
That my expences and Losses did  pritty  largely Exceed my income<br>
and how to retrench my outgoing I do not know unless I should 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

bereave my family of the necessary calls of humanity and<br>
decency which I thank god I have hitherto been enabled to A:<br>
void however in respect to my Sales of the tobo I sent to <a href="Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr. Daw<br>
kins
</a> I had reason to be better pleas'd than with most others<br>
that had a share of my Crops that year I do not well know the terms<br>
agreed upon between Mr Dawkins and yourself or how far<br>
you are in Partnership with him therefore can't make you<br>
any direct reply upon that Subject if he thinks it proper to  joyn <br>
you with himself I have so good an Esteem for you that I should<br>
be willing to treat with you under that denomination
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now Come to Your Letter to the <a href=#n2>Frying pan Compa
</a><br>
which was deliver'd me with the box of Ores the pains you were<br>
at in giving us so particular and full a Satisfaction in your<br>
 Tryals  was very pleasing to us all and we shall write a  joynt <br>
letter to you on that Affair and  beleive  shall  gratifye  your<br>
desire in making you our  cheif  Agent in transacting<br>
it
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wee  meet with abundance of Difficulties in the<br>
design our hopes and our doubts change almost as often<br>
as the tides so many demonstrable signs as We have met wth<br>
we think Cannot deceive us but that there must be a great<br>
load of valuable ore someWhere if we could fall upon the<br>
right way of Finding it but that we doubt we shall never<br>
do unless we can be provided with men of more skill than any<br>
we have yet met with All the ore that We have yet rais'd which<br>
we dare ship does not amount to above 50 Cask  [<i>sic
</i>]
</i>
</font>
</sup> that we reckon<br>
will contain about 400 wt each they are about the size of tar<br>
Barrells I have  talkt  with some masters of ships about<br>
the Freight of them we Expect enough would be glad to 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3

take them in this Scarce year but the lowest terms any hath of<br>
ferd as yet is 15/ per Cask thus this matter stands At present I<br>
think we Can never afford to give that price
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n3>Capt Dove
</a> according to your direction hath been<br>
at the mine and will be able to Answer all your Questions he design [s] <br>
home in <a href=#n4>Malbon
</a> who I reckon may get his business  Accomplishd <br>
by the last of next month
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest kindess you Can do us in this affair<br>
will be to procure a proper person  skiled  in Working these<br>
mines with a set of proper labourers Whose business has been<br>
to live undergound and whose trade hath been to  rais  these Ores<br>

</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Benjamin Graves was the son of Captain Thomas Graves (d. <i>ante
</i> 1720), long a captain of vessels trading to Virginia, and a special friend of Carter. Benjamin also commanded vessels in the trade, especially the <i>Carter.
</i>  ( Adm. 68/194-196, ff. 33r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company called the Frying Pan Company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B32">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.
</i>  pp. 18-19;
</a> and <a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .
</i>  p. 342. 
</a>)
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;
</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")
</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Rebecca 
</i> was probably a London Ship; she was of 300 tons, had a crew of 11, and was commanded by Samuel Malbon in 1731. ( Adm. 65/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

<br>Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your letter of the 27 of May  has been with me for some <br>
time all along I  designed  an Answer to it by the return of my son <br>
his stay at <a href=#n2>Fryingpan
</a> being longer than I Expected  has <br>
made me more dilatory than I intended.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wages you demand for your Bricklayer if <br>
he be a master Workman is a diligent quick fellow and posses [es]  <br>
with those good qualities you mention I think is not much  <S><font color="red">out
</font>
</S>  <br>
 <S><font color="red">of the way
</font>
</S>   amiss
</i> only the word Sterling scares me if you will be <br>
contented to take Cash I will come into that readily I have no <br>
present occasion for him I would have his time Commence <br>
from the first or middle of September he may carry on <a href=#n3> Rubbed 
</a> <br>
work all the Winter and be ready when the Summer comes to <br>
lay Bricks if this pleases you and I suppose it will not be ag=<br>
ainst the inclinations of the fellow I will stand concluded by the <br>
Bargain
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to your other Offer about <a href=#n4>Mr Champs
</a> land <br>
were the times as easy to get money in as I have known them <br>
I would not make two words about the Price but the word sterl=

ing is frightful to me. there also the buildings further than <br>
houses to cure tobacco  <S><font color="red">or

Advantage to me and the Old fields and  cleared  grounds which <br>
must be  presumed  to have been out of the best of the Land accor<br>
ding to my information are much larger than you suppose <br>
And the Lands to be  Cleared  chiefly hilly and upon Swamp sides <br>
however if there be eight hundred Acres and Mr. Champ can make <br>
me an indisputable Title I will adventure to give one hundred &amp;<br>
fifty Pounds for it With that terryfying word Sterling added <br>
to it and will give my bills of Exchange immediately upon <br>
passing proper Assurances for the Land this is within ten <br>
pounds of  your  proposal which I fancy will hardly turn away <br>
a good Customer -- You will particularly oblige me in being <br>
the instrument of handing the papers that relate to <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">Lloyds

Land to me I am

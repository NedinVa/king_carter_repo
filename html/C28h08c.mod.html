 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to the Earl of Orkney, August 8 and 28, 1728</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the governor of the Colony, the Earl of Orkney, August 8, 1728, to send a bill of exchange for the governor's final portion of the fees collected during Carter's administration as acting lieutenant governor. He also requests an additional letter of recommendation for his son. In a post script dated August 28th, Carter responds to  a letter just received from Orkney from which he has learned that William Dawkins apparently has refused to honor a bill of exchange sent by Carter's son.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> to be Copyd</i></i></b><br><br>
In mine of the 12th of  Decrembe.  I remitted to your <br> Lordship  my bills for your Salary to the End of my Administration and <br>for the <a href=#n1> Moiety </a> of the perquisites then  received  have Since got in the remainder <br>According to the Enclosed Account  a  moiety  whereof I now Send a bill of Exchange <br>for being &pound;30:17:11 on <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr. Dawkins</a> of London and I hope your   Lordship  <br>will think I have done you Justice to a little I am not Conscious <br>to my Self of keeping back a farthing  <S><font color="red">I was so full</font></S> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so full of presumption in my last Letter <br>to  beg  a favour of your  Lordship  in a recommendatory Letter to our <br> Governor  and I am now so Impertinent to make a Second request for <br>the Same favour I Shall be proud to receive your  Lordship's  notice of  [...]  <br>receipt of these two Letters and with the utmost Submission </p>

<br>Sir <br>Your Lordships <br>Most obedient Most Obliged &amp; <br>most humble Servant 
<br><br> [per the Car] ter
<br> [Copy per]  <a href=#n2> Captain  Wilcox</a><br>

 [M] y Lord&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; August  the 28th. 1728<br>
	Two days ago I  received   the  Honor  of your<br>  Lordship's   kind letter</i> of the 30th. of March the paragraph  relating  <br>to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr. Dawkins</a> is very  Shocking  It would be vanity <br>to tell your  Lordship  how much that person is in my Debt, and <br>by my  Endorsement  that bill was my own and well as the other <br>&amp; in respect to my Son, I have a great deal of reason to Conclude he had no Occa=<br>sion to treat his bill with so much disrespect he is a peevish  Gentleman  and parts with  our <br>money with as much reluctance as if it were his own, All that I shall add I think <br>he  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>   would not be so inconsiderate</i> to Suffer that bill to be protested I  beg  your   Lordship  not to Entertain <br>any harsh thoughts of my Son on this Account  I am as before

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. There is a 19th-century transcript of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. The leaf bearing this letter has suffered some marginal damage.</a>

<br><br>A different clerk as entered the words "to be Copyd" at the head of the letter as is indicated by the use of italics.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] A moiety is one of two approximately equal portions.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] No information about Captain Wilcox has been located.</a>

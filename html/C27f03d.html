He notes that he has received Stark's letter of February 20th, and hopes his shipment was not damaged in the grounding of the <i>Ann and Elizabeth,</i> and adds that there was on board a small shipment for the Burwell estate. He will ship 30 hogsheads on the <i>Lucia.</i></p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>John Stark,</a> June 3, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>June the 3d: 1727<br><br>Mr. John Stark<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already informd you that the great <br>Mortality I have  Sufferd  among my Slaves this last  wintr  <br>would bring me under the Occasion of drawing upon you for <br>a large Sum which I have now done to witt for Three hundred <br>pounds payable to Colonel <a href="Cbiodir.html#MCB">George  Braxston </a> desireing you will <br>answer this draft at time on my Accot: I do not Stand  Engagd  <br>for the payment of this money in London therefore I must leave <br>you to act in it as you See  fitt, </p>	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yors: by the  <S><font color="red">Ann</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">Eleanor</i></font></sup> and  <S><font color="red">Eliza</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">Mary</i></font></sup> of the 20th. of February <br>arrived here Since <a href=#n2>Kelsick</a>  Saild  in which you tell me you <br>Shall Soon Send me the Sales of my 23 hhds: per the <a href=#n3> Lucia </a> You <br>Say there is no damage in the Cargo of the  Ann and Eliz:  I hope I <br>Shall Suffer little there by the Ships running a Shoar besides my <br>10 hhds: there was 3 hhds: in that Ship belonging to <a href="Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr. Burwells <br>Estate</a>  orderd  to you whether a bill of Lading taken for it I am not <br>Sure I Load upon the Lucia Capt Bowman 30 hhds: whether <br>I Shall be able to get any for Nichalson I am not yet Certain <br>Shall Conclude here </p><br>S<u>ir</u> <br>Yor: very humble Servt.<br><br>per the Dispatch Capt.

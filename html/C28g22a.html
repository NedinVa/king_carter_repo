</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of 1727 May 17, Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,
</i> but little information about Bradley has been located.
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The 140 ton <i>Welcome
</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on 1727 May 17.  John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728.

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of 1727 May 17, Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,</i> but little information about Bradley has been located.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The 140 ton <i>Welcome</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on 1727 May 17.  John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1729. ( Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm 68/195, 154r, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The <i>Forward</i> was a London ship of 150-200 tons  commanded in 1728-29 by William Loney, and in 1731 by George Buckridge. ( Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194 and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a> )</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Isham Randolph was captain of the London ship  <i>Williamsburgh</i> in 1725-26, and Charles Rogers commanded her in 1727-28. ( Admiralty 68/194, ff. 39v, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1729 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission would be successful.   ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  [Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.] p. 116.</a>)</a>

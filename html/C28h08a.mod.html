 Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>Augst: 8th: 1728<br><br>
Mr. Edwd. Athawes<br>
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours . of the 29th: of  December  is now before me <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr. Daw=<br>kins</a>  has  not intimated to me any thing of his taking you into <br>partnership with him when he does I shall be better able to return <br>you an Answer,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My business  has  been Con [signed]    to</i> Mr. Dawkins <br>for many years but I have too often fou [nd from exper] ience  [that]  <br>the larger my Concerns were the worse hat [h been my return]  

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
and the more dilatory my Sales, the last year Mr. Dawkins had <br>a large Share of my buiness, My Accounts  are not yet  Completed  <br>and that which troubles me most is to find my Crops Sells at a penny <br>per pound less than many  Genlemen  upon York river of my long Acquaintance had <br>for theirs the reasons of this prodigious difference I shall never be able <br>to fathom times have been when  we  were upon a Level and I have <br>Instances to show when I have Exceeded them I Should not be so partic<br>ular to you but for the intimacy you acquaint me you have in <br>my Affairs I have Just now  received  Mr. Dawkins's Sale of my 20 hogsheads <br>per <a href=#n1>Keeling</a> it Seems on the 18th: of May he had 25 hogsheads of my other <br>Concern unsold I will please my Self with the hopes to come  off  as <br>well at least with these unaccounted for as them I have the Sales <br>of.  We  are  fallen  into very poor times it is dificult for us to live <br> [u] nder a Series of so many Successive mean years. The <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter </a> con<br> [t] inues to be an unfortunate Ship I almost think I am taking <br>my leave of her for good and all, and can hardly think the O [wners?]  <br>will any longer  be</i>  Satisfied  in  making  any more  losing  V [oyages]  <br>and unless a better provision be made for her and She be und [er a]  <br>better regulation I cant Entertain hopes of better Success She has <br>bin all along a heavy load upon me and I have never  failed  of <br>loading my Quota and more and yet must be brought in for a <br>Share in the loss a very disagreeable  Story  I am </p>

<br>Your  humble Servt: -- <br><br>per Carter<br>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. The leaf of the letter book on which this letter was written has some marginal damage and a missing portion at the bottom.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

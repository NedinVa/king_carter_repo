 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins, April 16, 1730</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to  London merchant William Dawkins, April 16, 1730, to report that he has received the accounts of sales of his tobacco and that the goods have arrived in good condition. He complains about the extremely low prices received for his tobacco, and comments on the small crops presently in Virginia and Maryland. Most of the letter is devoted to his business in the hands of merchant John Falconar who had died, and his instructions to Dawkins in representing Carter to Falconar's executors. He encloses a letter that Dawkins is to present to the executors.</p>

 Rappa[hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br>
<br>April 16.. 1730<br><br>
Mr: William Dawkins<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have receiv'd your several letters this year your<br>
accounts of sales and your Account Currt. your sales indeed are the lowest<br>
as you observe I think that ever you gave me however to be inginious take<br>
them round they are the best has fallen to my  Lott  for that years Crop  [ . . . ] </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I have receiv'd my goods in good condition the <a href=#n1> Bailey </a><br>
arriv'd this day three Weeks all that I shall be able to load upon her this year<br>
will be between 50 and 70 hhds how he will come off himself does not yet<br>
Know We have little outport trade yet the Scotch talk of a great many<br>
fewer ships to come from thence than Usual this probably will very<br>
much help the Londoners the masters are driving about after freight 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
all the Country over if there be any regard to report [s]  from all parts both<br>
of Virginia and Maryland you may depend upon a Very short crop<br>
I cannot reckon there will be so much by at least 10,000 hhds as went<br>
out <sup><font color="green">from Virginia</i></font></sup> Last year for my own part I have Concerns in all our rivers &amp;<br>
 pritty  large ones at the Falls of this I am sure I shall fall short of<br>
500 <sup><font color="green">wt</i></font></sup> of tobo per share considerably less than I made in the <a href=#n2> gust </a> year</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yours of the 24th of Janry by the  Haswell,  you tell me you<br>
had sold some of my tobo at 8 1/2 my letters by that ship advise me<br>
that the market was rising I am in hopes you will be able to advance<br>
the price for what of my tobacco remains unsold you are not<br>
 unsencible  of the Vast Expence we live at Small crops poor  priz= <br>
es great  Salarys  and great  mortailitys  and less for the maintainan<sup><font color="green">ce </i></font></sup><br>
of my  Familys  I cannot Subsist with I can too truely say I grow poorer<br>
and poorer Every Year I live</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of <a href=#n3>Mr Falconar</a> fills me full of doubts what is to be=<br>
come of my Affairs in his hands his Son here tells me himself and 2<br>
very Substantial honest men in  London  are his fathers Executors<br>
and promises me all imaginable justice Pressing me Strongly to con <br>
tinue my business to him he seems to be an ingenious man for his years<br>
but old heads are not to be found upon young Shoulders I cannot think it<br>
prudent to continue my Correspondence with that house  till  I see what<br>
Course the young man will steer and I cannot think of any friend I<br>
have in London so proper to intrust this Affair to as yourself &amp;<br>
hope you will serve me in it both strenuously and with diligence<br>
Accordingly I send you inclosed a letter to Mr Falconars Executors<br>
Whereby to demand of them an Accot of my Concerns and to receive<br>
of them the money that is due to me from Mr Falconar upon his<br>
accot  Currant  and also the produce of certain quantities <sup><font color="green">of tobo</i></font></sup> that were 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br>
<sup><font color="green">just sold &amp;</i></font></sup> to sell at the writing of his last letter he hath sent me two Accounts<br>
Curtts of late the first of them Bears date June 10th.. 1728. In this<br>
account his ballance in my favour is &pound;1121"9"8 herein he gives<br>
me Credit for 13 hogsheads by <a href=#n4>James Hopkins</a> 20 hogsheads  by <a href=#n5>George Buckr=<br>
idge</a> and 17 hogsheads by <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS">Thomas Dove</a> this tobo was sold the 16th<br>
of April 1728. He sends me another account Currt date June<br>
14th 1729 the ballance due to me in that Accot is &pound;1099"12"1<br>
In that accot he gives me Credit for 8 hhds by <a href=#n6>James Bradby</a> for<br>
20 by <a href=#n7>Peter Wills</a> and for 10 hogsheads by Ditto</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his letter of the 29th of September 1729 is this follow <br>
in [g]  clause "The 11th of April 1728 I sold 29 hhds of tobacco to Alderm<br>
"an Levett 20 of which were  thine  amounting to &pound;535"16"2 that<br>
"was the first time I ever dealt with the Alderman and I believ'd him<br>
"to be a Safe man but he has  Stopt  payment and is to meet his credit <br>
"ors in a few days he owes I am told about &pound;5000" for Tobacco what<br>
"his propositions will be I know not but the loss I hope will not be grea<sup><font color="green">t</i></font></sup><br>
"for I have receiv'd two thirds of the money, more I am told than he<br>
"has paid to all the trade since the time I dealt with him it is a<br>
"Sign the tobo trade is very bad when an Alderman and Sheriff of<br>
"London shall br<sup><font color="green">e</i></font></sup>ak. <sup><font color="green">thus far Mr. Falconar</i></font></sup> I shall not make any Observation upon  this<br>
proceeding only to  noat  that I am advis'd according to the Circumstances<br>
of this transaction I am not  lyable  to bear any loss by the Breaking<br>
of Mr Levett, Last Year I sent to Mr. Falconar 30 hogsheads of tobo<br>
by Peter Wills and 11 by Bradby also 2 <a href=#n8> Luggs </a> by Bells Ship of the<br>
30 by Wills he gives me an Accot  <S><font color="red">of the sales of</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">he had sold</i></font></sup> 27 hhds those<br>
by Bradby as choice a Crop as any upon York River; likewise<br>
17 hogsheads a Crop I sent him out of James River  markt   [tobacco mark]  a choice<br>
Crop also  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">were</i></font></sup> unsold these  [tobacco mark]  were the produce<br>
of a plantation of mine the profits whereof however I design'd for <a href="Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr Burwells</a><br>
remains and Mr Falconar Accots for them in a particular<br>
manner under the denomination of <a href="Cbiodir.html#MH">Merchants hundreds</a> esta[ te] 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>4</i>-</center><br><br>
The crop that went by Bradby in 1728 the same Crop sold at 9d<br>
 cleard  me above &pound;10" per hogshead equal to any of Mr Burwells tobo=<br>
and I expect these 11 hogsheads will  yeild  at least as much He hath<br>
also been a large manager of Mr Burwells affairs and stands<br>
considerably in debt to that Estate to be Accounted for to me</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now how <sup><font color="green">is best for</i></font></sup> you to Proceed in this Affair I am at<br>
a loss to give you instructions if you find there is no danger<br>
of a fair and punctual proceeding with me you will Act the<br>
more Calmly but if otherwise I hope your  Zeall  will be the<br>
warmer to see that I have right done me I think you are<br>
already qualify'd as my attorney in London as I remember I sent<br>
you a general power of Attorney in the <a href=#n9>Case of Wise</a> I am<br>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] While the clerk clearly wrote down "gust," either his or Carter's attention must have been straying. In the context of the letter, "last" was what was intended. No use of "gust" for "last" appears in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary.</i></a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See Carter to William Dawkins, and Carter to Falconar's executors, both 1730 April 16, for Falconar's death date.  Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Captain James Hopkins commanded the <i>Mary</i> in 1727-1728. He was then working for London merchant Robert Cary. He is mentioned in Carter's diary. ( Adm. 68/194, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The <i>Marlborough</i> was a vessel of 100 tons and 14 men, commanded by George Buckeridge (Buckbridge). In a letter to London merchant John Falconar 1727 July 24, Carter refers to this vessel as "yor. Marlborrough." ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Captain James Bradby commanded the <i>Micajah and Philip. </i>( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, ff. 74v, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <i>Booth</i> in 1723-1724, and the <i>Amity,</i> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary for June 1723.  ( Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194, and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195,Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n8">[8]  "The lowest grade [of tobacco] was known as lugs as early as 1686. . . ." (Philip A. Bruce.  <i>Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth Century: An Inquiry into the Material Condition of the People, Based on Original and Contemporaneous Records.</i>  [New York: MacMillan and Co., 1896]. p. 422 online at "Classics of American Colonial History." http://www.dinsdoc.com/bruce-1-1.htm) </a>
  
<br><br><a name="n9">[9] Carter and Thomas Wise had "traded with each other in tobacco and bills of exchange between 1707 and 1717," but Wise "neglected his duty in returning those bills that were protested." Carter sued Wise in England to recover his money, and he won &pound;180. ( Survey Report 10147 describing C24/1398 part 1, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> and letter of 1723 August 19, Carter to Micajah Perry</a>

<br><br><a name="n10">[10] Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel named the <i> Loyalty</i>in 1729-1730. (Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter's letters to John Pemberton 1730 April 15 and 1731 August 4.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n11">[11] The <i>Rebecca </i> was probably a London Ship; she was of 300 tons, had a crew of 11, and was commanded by Samuel Malbon in 1731. ( Adm. 65/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

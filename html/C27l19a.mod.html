The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Christian was captain of the <i>Rose,</i> a vessel owned by merchant John Pemberton of Liverpool. (See Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15.) </a><br><br><a name="n2">[2]  The impost was the duty imposed by Britain on imported tobacco, and the cocket (for which a fee was charged) was the certified document issued that the impost had been paid.</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] The <i>John &amp; Betty</i> was a Liverpool ship often carrying slaves owned by merchant John Pemberton. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729.

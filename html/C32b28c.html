Carter sends a bill of lading (not present) for 50 hogsheads, and asks Pemberton to have Foster Cunliffe handle it if he will not. He adds remarks about the difficulties posed by the handling of tobacco required by the new inspection law, and sends a bill of exchange (not present).

He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. ( James A.

" The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al. </i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. </i> </a> pp. 236-39.)</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Liverpool</a> </BODY></HTML>

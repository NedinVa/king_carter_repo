He orders more, and is quite specific thatthey are not to be black because those rot quickly in Virginia. Healerts Pemberton to a bill of exchange drawn on him to Samuel Bousch,and notes that he would have sent tobacco on board Captain Hancock'sship but the freight rate was too high. He encloses a bill of ladingfor 30 hogsheads of tobacco sent on this ship. In a brief postscript,he reports a bill of exchange. In a longer postscript dated March 28,1721, Carter orders 3-400 bushels of salt and 4-500 yards of strongLiverpool linen. He expects to ship 30 or 40 hogsheads of tobacco onthe <i>Content</i> if Capt. Stephenson will accept&pound;9 per ton freight charge. In his own hand, Carter adds anotherpostscript requesting Pemberton find two indentured servants toreplace John Babe, a clerk, and Marget Upton, the best female servantCarter has ever had.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JP"> JohnPemberton,</a> February 14 and March 28, 1721</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [LancasterCounty, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br>Febr.  14.1720/21 <br>Mr. John Pemberton<br> <br>Sir --  -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor.

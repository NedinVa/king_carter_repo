 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Robert Jones, December 4, 1728</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his manager, Robert Jones of Prince William County, December 4, 1728, to chastise him for his "abundance of words" and lack of action, and to let Jones know that he has a good candidate to replace him. He will give Jones one more year but if Jones is planning to move, he wishes to know at once so that he may hire the candidate. He then turns to the disappointing wheat crop and poor quantities of tallow. He gives specific instructions for the herding of his hogs down from plantation to plantation, noting that he has promised certain of the hands that they may come "down" at Christmas, and they could herd the hogs. He writes of the need  to present the deeds for lots in Falmouth to the county court, and hopes that Jones and two other witnesses to the deeds will be present. </p>

<br>Decr. 4th. 1728<br><br>
Mr Robt Jones<br>
 


<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now upon yours of the 7th of  November  if abundance of <br>words would Answer the want of Deeds I must Allow you would pass for one <br>of the best managers I ever had to do with but where there wants performan=<br>ces this wordy talent is of little value in my esteem I shall only tell you upon <br>your huge promises I Shall adventure to make a  trial  of you one year long<br> [e] r that is to enter into Fresh Articles with you when your last year is up <br> although  I have now the offer of a very good man to come into your place <br> [who]  has  behaved  himself very well in business of the same nature with <br>yours And is clear of A Burthensome family which you know is no sm<br>all charge to me in yours being so large so that it is very much in consider<br>ation of the straights you would be under that brings me into the humor <br>of continuing you Another year And therefore if you will be so  cheerful  &amp; <br>easy Under a present remove as you seem to hint I am very willing you sho-<br>uld take your leave of me as soon as you have  performed  the conditions <br>of your last years  Agreement  and this I would have you Advise me of by the <br>first  Opportunity  that I may close with the person now Offering himself <br>of whose both industry and Ability I have a very good Opinion</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now take into consideration the Accot you <br>send me of the Wheat and other things you tell me of Seven Bushels and <br>one half I spent which was very great House keeping considering I was so <br>Much of my time at the Out quarters but that I do not Much mind it <br>more Concerns me that you have sowed no more certainly there might <br>have four or five bushels been sowed there as well as At the Other  quarters  <br>especially considering How convenient the Wheat there is the crops <br>at the Other  quarters  fall a great deal short of what the overseers told me <br>some of them at Least Sabin  talked  of a hundred Bushels so did Willia [ms]  <br>at the least and So did Cassety the Butter pots are a pretty many in <br>number they are most of them but small I wish you had Added the 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
 weights  Upon your Tickets and I wish that the small quantities of butter <br>made may not be the Occasion of the Loss of several of the Calves several  [of]  <br>them were so poor and Small that without a great deal of care const<br>ant housing and good feeding they will not be  wintered   Although  with <br>good care I am  satisfied  they may for from my own Experience this very <br>year several poor Calves by housing and feeding with the benefit of <br>the Corn fields are grown to be likely &amp; lusty and no fear of  wintering  <br>them</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of  Hogs  you tell me you  reckoned  upon to be <br> fattened  at the several  quarters  amount to 86 Out of these After the over=<br>seers have their Share some for the people and what will be for your <br>provision I hope you will be able to Afford me Fifty or at Least near it <br>And I would have of the best of them too Some meat must be kept for <br><a href=#n1>Hurst</a> while he is at work Upon the Town houses Now I am upon <br>that Subject  it is  proper to let you know that I have got a promise of <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr <br>Chichester</a> to get what Fraiming Stuff I have Occasion for off of h [is]  <br>Land for my buildings at the Town which will save a great deal of La [bour] </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tallow you send me Down is of very different  weights  your beef <br>yielded 31 pounds the <a href="Cbiodir.html#">RichLand</a> 33 pounds and one half the <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Park</a> 18 3/4 pounds and the <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Pop<br>lar</a> but 14 1/4 pounds. your and RichLand is a great deal short of what I <br> Used  to have but Certainly Williams &amp; Sabin have  played  the rogue <br>egregiously in their Tallow</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What  Hogs  I am to have I must have them Drove down to me <br>and I would have them come in Two  parcels  as <a href=#n2>Roger Oxford</a> indeed pro<br> posed  to Me to be the best way its very common to the Southward to drive <br> Hogs  as far they put them into Large enclosures three or four days be<br>fore they set off with them and Drive them about with Horses and <br>then they tell me they manage them with a great deal of ease there are <br>Several Gentlemen in the way that I dare say would Afford them con<br>veniencys for  a </i>Night As <a href=#n3> Major  Thornton</a> <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Colonel  Smith</a> there is <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Colonel  <br>Pages </a> Quarter  at Nansatico where particular Orders are given to give enter=<br> tainment . to my Overseers and  Hogs  then there is the head of <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#">Nomini</a> Next to that my <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Fieldings</a> and my <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Morattico </a>  quarters  and so down to the <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#">Office</a> these Stages in My thoughts will make the Matter Easy I have <br> promised  Ben and Jacob and the Carpenter boys that they shall come <br>down this Christmas to see their relations I reckon about that 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br>
time these  Hogs  will be fit to come away You may Contrive to let the <br>Carpenters come at the same time and to make them Help down <br>with the  Hogs  which will save  your  sending Others</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have bought <a href=#n4>Innis's</a> land the Deeds are executed I had <br>once intended to send them to you to get them Acknowledged but I was exp<br>ecting to be up at this Court I thought it more proper to send them to  Major  <br>Thornton I have also sent to him mine and my familys Deeds for the <a href=#n5>town</a> <br>Lots in Order to their being Acknowledged our best Lawyers Assure me <br>it is Absolutely necessary to be done three of the Witnesses Appearing and giv<br>ing their  testimony  to the Execution of the Deeds confirms the title and no<br>thing less will do you that are the Evidences at least three of you I hope will <br>not fail to Appear at the Court for this purpose and I reckon all that have <br>bought Lots will be willing to have the same Security</p>

<br><br> The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Hust (or Hurst) was the overseer of "Hamstead Quarter," Stafford County, in the 1732 inventory, supervising  sixteen slaves with the assistance of one horse. Hust apparently was a carpenter because Carter mentions his doing carpentry work in various letters. (<a href="Cbibl.html#">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Roger Oxford was the overseer at Norman's Ford.</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Major William Thornton (d. 1742/43) of King George County. (  <i>King George County Virginia Will Book A-1 1721-1752 And Miscellaneous Notes.</i>  [Fredericksburg, VA: Privately Printed, 1978], p. 277.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Carter acquired this Richmond County property toward the end of 1728. Enoch Innis inherited it from his father, James, who died in 1709. ( Lucy Jane Brent Palmer, "Charles Brent of Stafford County and Some of His Descendants,"  <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</i> , 34(1926): 280-85 and 378-84</a>; and  "Abstracts From Records of Richmond County, Virginia,"  <i>William and Mary Quarterly</i> , (1)17(1908-09): 176-177, which cites records of Richmond County concerning this will, probated 25 December 1709, as from Will Book 3</a>).</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The new town of Falmouth was created by the Assembly in February 1727. Carter, Mann Page, Nicholas Smith, William Thornton, John Fitzhugh, Charles Carter, and Henry Fitzhugh the younger were the "directors and trustees." The land chosen for the site of the new town lay in King George County, and deeds would have been recorded in its court records.  ( William Waller Hening,  <i>The Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of the Laws of Virginia . . . . </i> [Richmond, 1820. reprint, 1969]. IV, 234-39.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Henry Shelton was one of Carter's overseers, and they settled in December 1722 on terms for his employment for the coming year as Carter noted in his diary.</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] William Threalkill (Threalkild) is mentioned in the inventory of Carter's estate as the overseer at Poplar Quarter, Stafford County. (<a href="Cbibl.html#">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."</a>.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n8">[8] Charles Brent (d. 13 January 1756) of Overwharton Parish, Stafford County, married to Hannah Innes. He acted as collector of quit rents for Carter in the county.</a>

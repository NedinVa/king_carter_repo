</i> <br><br>May the. 23d: 1728<br><br>Mr. John Mercer -- <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours  of the 9th Instant came to me the 21st: you <br>seem to be in a great deal of  haste  for the Consummation of  our  bargain <br>but  we  must not make more  haste  than good speed I have  written  to <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#NS">Colonel Smith
</a> an Account of the Treaty between us and I  believe  if he <br>can be secure of his money in my hands he will be patient  until   we  <br>can finish the matter as  we  ought,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have Sent me  Alexander  Waughs Deed to <a href=#n2>Colonel <br>Mason
</a> but you have not Sent me  Joseph  Waughs Deed to his Brothers <br>John. Alexander and David, These I must see before I can be well <br>Apprized of all the Circumstances of the Case, neither have you Sent <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2
</i>-
</center><br><br>me the clear proof you promised of the time of your wifes age, by Mrs. Pear=<br>sons Testimony and others. There is a further thing necessary to be done <br>before I can tell how to draw the Deeds that is to run the dividing line <br>between Colonel Mason and you with his Approbation &amp; Consent, and <br>to run the side lines of your 1610 Acres leaving a full division of the Fifth <br>part of the last  great
</i> Tract into David Waughs part in making these Lines &amp; <br>returning me a platt Mr. <a href=#n3>John Warner
</a> the Surveyor hath full ins<br>tructions from me and will be ready to do it when you &amp; Colonel Mason <br>will appoint the time, This work you will have  <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S>  in your power to hasten <br>You know also there is a  joint  Bond to be  Signed  by Colonel Mason &amp; you <br>for the repayment of the money for the 400 and odd Acres Surplus land <br>in Case the Judgement of Law should be that your wife has no right <br>to it, this bond must be Executed before I pay my money.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the Deeds of  Joseph  Waughs and Alexander <br>not to be worded alike Alexanders is not so Strong in favour of the <br>Surplus Lands as  Joseph  Waughs is, therefore I have the more reason to <br>desire the Sight of  Joseph  Waughs Deeds to his Several Brothers,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for your  losing  by the rate now  Set upon Silver <br>that need not trouble you my payment will be most in Gold, My <br>Son <a href="Cbiodir.html#CC1">Charles
</a> I reckon will be up at the Falls about the 10th of next month <br>and that will Suit pretty well with your time of Stafford Court I am 
</p><br>Your  humble Servant <hr><center><h3>NOTES

"He married first on June 10, 1725 Catherine Mason (June 21, 1707-June 15, 1750) only child of Colonel George Mason (16??-1716) and his second wife Elizabeth Waugh, daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Waugh."(<a href="Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William

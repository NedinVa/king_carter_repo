His accounts from London merchant Micajah Perry show that the rents have been paid, and he complains that he is unable to obtain rents from land holders to equal that he pays. He has received the new lease for the Virginia agency and the terms are hard ones which he may be able to meet but that his executors will have difficulties with. With the letter he sends accounts (not present) that clearly show that the proprietor owes Edmund Jenings &pound;39 /14 and Jening's agent is in London to present them. The case in the colonial courts in which the proprietor is claiming certains fees and fines is moving very slowly to be summarized for presentation to the Board of Trade, and he notes a new cause that Cage and Lord Fairfax may wish him to pursue: there has been a suicide and Carter believes the guilty man's goods belong to the proprietor. He closes with a complaint that Cage seldom writes.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WC">William Cage,</a> Esq., July 19, 1725</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa [hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>July 19th: 1725<br><br>Wm: Cage Esqr:<br> <br>Sr:<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By my accot: Currt: from <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr: Perry</a> I find you are --  <br> entirely  paid of your  Rents to <a href=#n1> Michaelmas </a> last, which I hope is to your  full --  <br>Satisfaction, you must allow me to tell you I shall not get half  money  enough <br>in for the last years Rent to answer what I paid for it,  tobacco  I have got little <br>or  none,  now it is worth Something they have us'd that little they made to other <br>purposes and leave me in the  lurch </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have  received  yor: new Lease from Mr: Perry its upon very hard terms, -- <br>while my life lasts I flatter my self I can do as well with it as many man, <br>but I grow old and if it please God to take me away before the end of it, I <br>am afraid my  executors  will hardly be able to do so well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein I Send you a clear accot: of Some further  payments  Adamson has <br>made to the  proprietors  in behalf of <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#EJ"> Colonel  Jennings,</a> whereby it appears very <br>Clearly that you Stand indebted to  Colonel  Jennings, Thirty nine pound fourteen <br> shillings,  This last accot: of Adamsons I had the pusal   [<i>sic</i>]</i>of, the articles there <br>Stand as they are here Recited, Adamson is now in London to  justify  them <br>to you, so that I think nothing Remains, but to expect that you will  please  <br>to Send me your  orders to pay Jenning his Balance who is  really  in a most <br>necessitous condition and dearly wants it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to give you an accot: of yor: Cause with the Crown, it --  <br>Stands continued in the General Court, the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#HD"> Governor </a> Sends home a state <br>of the Case to the Board of trade to have their directions what he shall <br>do, the Lawyers have been very dilatory in preparing this State of the <br>Case, each side Charge the other to be the Occasion of this delay, I have <br> [directed the?]</i> Lawyers as soon as it is finished to Send me a Copy th [at]</i> <br>I may take the first opportunity to transmit to his <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#TF">Lordship</a> and your  <br>self, I Expected it before now but it is not come</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

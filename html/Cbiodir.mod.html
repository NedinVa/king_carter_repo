Hayward assembled a syndicate composed of London merchants  Robert Bristow  (1643-1707)  and  Richard Foote  (his brother-in-law), and  George Brent  of  "Woodstock,"   Stafford County.  The syndicate purchased on January 10, 1686/87, from Lord Culpeper, by then the sole owner of the Northern Neck Proprietary, 30,006 acres in Stafford County  "Between the Courses of the said Two Rivers, Rappahannock and Potowmack  . . . upon and Between the Southwest and Northeast Branches of Ocaquant Creek. . . ."  Hayward obtained a dispensation from King James II that would allow the Hugenots that he hoped to settle on the land to have the  "full exercise  of their Religion."  The town that Hayward hoped to build on the tract was called Brenton,  "but this was corrupted by local [Virginia] usage into Brent Town, and that came to be the designation of the whole tract."  Hayward was not successful in persuading Hugenots to move to the lands, and, after flirting with other possibilities, the tract remained unsettled and unsurveyed at the time of his death about 1697. The members of the syndicate and their heirs bequeathed and sold their rights in the Brenton tract for generations. RC was to have considerable trouble over the tract after becoming agent of the proprietors  again in 1721. He was pressed to grant lands in the area of Brenton, but it was very difficult to do so because the tract had not been surveyed -- and was not to be until 1737-1738.  Fairfax Harrison, in a chapter entitled  "Brent Town, Ravensworth and the Hugenots,"  in his  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William</i>  (from which all quotations used here are taken) tells the story of Brent Town  extremely well.

He is usually referred to as  "Major Bristow,"  probably because of his service at this time.

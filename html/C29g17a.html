<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. This brief letter was squeezed into the  letter book after Carter's addendum of 1729 June 20 to his letter of 1729 April 11 to Pemberton. It is clearly to Pemberton and is not marked as a further addendum to the  letter of 1729 April 11 and accoordingly has been treated separately.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Several vessels named <i>The Loyalty</i> sailed to Virginia. Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel of this name in 1729-1730 as did James Tarleton in 1731. ( Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a> See also Carter's letters to John Pemberton 1730 April 15 and 1731 August 4.)</a>

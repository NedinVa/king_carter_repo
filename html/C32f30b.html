</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant  Alderman [Micajah] Perry, June 1732, to alert him to renewed attacks upon the proprietary in the current assembly, and to send a record of "their votes" as he has to Thomas Lord Fairfax. He relates the problems ship masters are having in finding complete cargoes, and hopes this will mean a better market for tobacco.

</sup> <br><br>June 1732<br><br>Alderman Perry<br> <br>Sir<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I writ to you by the <a href=#n1>  Rebeca  
</a> at some Length about my <a href="Cbiodir.html#TF">Lord <br>Fairfax's
</a> Affairs. The Burgesses are now making a fresh attack against <br>his Lordship's grant as you will see by their Votes, which I have thought it my <br>Duty by this first Opportunity to transmit to his Lordship tht he may be upon <br>his Guard in the Defence of his Estate; &amp; I send also a Copy of these Votes for your <br>Perusal. The Money they voted for  solliciting  their Petition in the Former <br>Session was disallowed by the Council; but whether it will meet with the <br>same Fate now I cannot take upon me to say. I expect the Gentlemen of <br>our Revenue will leave no Stone unturned to carry their Point for <br>Reasons I have formerly mentioned to you.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Bradby of the <a href=#n2> Spotswood 
</a>  hath  lately visited me &amp; makes <br>a heavy Complaint of the Little Hopes he is in of getting his Ship near Loaded, &amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;names <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</sup> <br> tells me he  hath   writ  these stories to You both by the  Rebeca  &amp; by <a href=#n3>Brooks.
</a> I have <br>done all in my Power towards Loading your ships. Seabrook they say will <br>get full. What <a href=#n4>Dove
</a> will be able to do he can't yet tell. Your chartered Ship <br>takes a great deal away from him. We flatter ourselves these Things will <br>have a great Influence upon the Markets towards our Relief under our <br>Unhappy Circumstances. I am, 
</p><br>Sir, <br>Your most Humble Servant.<hr><center><h3>NOTES

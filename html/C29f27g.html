ible to follow there being nothing  wee  eat but must have butter to make it savou<br>
ry and I dare say Doctr. Bave himself can much Easier give this advice  then  <br>
take it, however I follow it as.much as reasonably I can with abundance of <br>
regularity and a great deal of Exercise with the use of frequent Purges of <a href=#n2>And=<br>

my greatest disturbance is about midnight when I am so frequently oppresed <br>
that I know not how to live the greatest of my Malady proceeds from wind Occ=<br>

 fitts  are so violent heaving me into so much Confusion which makes me un<br>
fit for any business take away all my resolution distracts my mind &amp; <br>
fills me with ungovernable thoughts  rendring  all the  Idie's  of my soul in dark <br>
and  discourageing  Colours.which I have not the power to  dispell  by the Consid<br>
 eracions  of all the liberal mercys I am under which by the good hand of Providence<br>
I must own are not a few and when ever I transgress a little either in Eating <br>
or drinking to be sure that night I am to be miserably tormented.</p>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Pratt was a London merchant and an old friend of Carter's who usually referred to him as "Daddy."</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Anderson's Scots Pills, a product of the 1630's, had been invented by Patrick Anderson, a Scot, who wrote in a book published in 1635 that he had learned the secret of the pills in Venice. He passed the formula to his daughter Katherine who in turn passed it to a doctor named Thomas Weir in 1686. Weir obtained letters patent on the formula from James II in 1687. ( George B. Griffenhagen and James Harvey Young, "Old English Patent Medicines in America," in  <i>Contributions From the Museum of History and Technology</i>  (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1959), paper 10, 156-183.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See Carter to William Dawkins, and Carter to Falconar's executors, both 1730 April 16, for Falconar's death date.  Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</a>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, October 12, 1728, to order rugs, blankets, cloth for bedding, and sieves. He suggests to the merchant that he will be willing to own an eighth share in a new ship to be named for himself, and captained by Tom Dove as he is assuming that the <i>Carter
</i> will be sold.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] According to the  <i>Oxford English Dictionary,
</i>  which cites the  <i>Draper's Dictionary,
</i>  barras is "a coarse linen fabric originally imported from Holland."
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Probably the clerk meant to write "fine" rather than "rine."
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] A riddle is a coarse sieve.

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The Rappahannock
</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Carter sent letters by Captain Naylor in the fall of 1728, but apparently the ship was lost on its way to Liverpool because Carter noted to William Dawkins 1728 June 29, the ship "hath never been heard of."

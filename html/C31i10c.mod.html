 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Alderman [Micajah] Perry, September 10, 1731</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, September 10, 1731, to cover a bill of lading (not present) for tobacco, and commenting that tobacco has been harvested but the corn crop is ordinary. He orders a pair of Cologne millstones for a mill he is building at Rippon Hall, and reminds Perry of his earlier orderes for Madeira and pipe tobacco. He has read Perry's "friendly" letter to Judith (Carter) Page, and hopes that the "Irish stockings" he has ordered for the Page "people" will arrive before winter.</p>

<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have little to say to you at this time <a href=#n1> Captain  Wills</a> <br>

bills of Lading for 15 hogsheads of tobacco which came not to hand  until  <br>
he was gone Herein send you a bill of Lading for it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our crops are now in the house what to say of <br>
them I dont know most parts complain of a  drout  our corn <br>
 fields  are generally Very Ordinary and  it is  the opinion of a great <br>
many we shall not Exceed what was made last Year for my <br>
own part I have no Prospect of doing of it the Countrys so very <br>
much Expanded and we have been so Often  deceived  in Our guesses <br>
that I shall say no more about it As for our <a href=#n2>Mine adventures</a> <br>
we had a little run of hopes rais'd about three or four ton [s]  <br>
of good Ore which We send to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr. Athawes</a> the vein is gone out <br>
and Our hopes flag upon it</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am building a mill at <a href=#n3>Rippon</a> in York<br> 
River I desire you will send me in in one of  Your  Ships into York <br>
a pr. of   Cologne   Millstones to be landed at Rippon hall I would <br>
have them four foot and An inch Over with a  frog  and a <br>
Spindle proper for a trib mill  as we call them I shall want no <br>
brasses to her I hope you will remember to Order me two pipes <br>
of Wine by  Your  ship that calls at  Madeira  You have  charged  <br>
me freight at 40  Shillings . Per pipe Sterling I should have paid it here <br>
at currentcy And I also  hope</i> you will not forget to send me a box of <br>
 Pipe   tobacco </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen  your  letter to Mrs. Page Via Maryland <br>
in Answer to one she Writ in March --  it is indeed a very friendly one 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
and from it I conceive good hopes that business may run in= <br>
different Smooth --  it is Admirable what became of mine &amp; <br>
my Sons letters which we wrote a month before just After the <br>
funeral <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Colonel  Pages</a> people are  entirely  without Irish Stockings <br>
we wrote an early letter to you desiring a Supply by the first Oppor <br>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <i>Booth</i> in 1723-1724, and the <i>Amity,</i> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary for June 1723.  ( Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194, and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195,Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful. (<a href="Cbibl.html#">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.</i>  pp. 18-19;</a> and <a href="Cbibl.html#">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .</i>  p. 342. </a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. ( "Notes and Queries."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.</i>  2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278.</a>)</a>

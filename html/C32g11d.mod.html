</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Alderman [Micajah] Perry, July 11, 1732, reiterating  his  often expressed complaints about the low prices realized by his tobacco, and to ask that Perry consider giving him a discount because of the large amounts of cash Carter has had in his hands. He notes some problems with the Merchants Hundred account, and reports bills of exchange.

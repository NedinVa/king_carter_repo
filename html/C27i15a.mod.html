The captain apparently has arranged with John Tayloe to handle the sale. He reports the arrival of the governor and the proclamation of King George II, and that he is assisting Captain Christian of the <i>Rose</i> in the sale of his cargo of slaves. Captain Denton of  the <i>John and Betty</i> sold a slave to a man named Killby whom Carter is sure will not be able to pay and he expects Denton to reimburse him.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>John Pemberton,</a> September 15, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to Mr. Pemberton's last Letter<br><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>Sepr. the 15th. 1727<br><br>[John Pemberton]<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After  Captain  Hayes in the  Leopard  had been in York <br>river to meet with <a href=#n2>Mr. Nelson</a> who is  gone  for England and find<br>ing no Orders for him there he came into this river to me, up<br>on Seeing the Strictness of your Orders I told him I could not meddle <br>with his Slaves it being impossible in my Esteem at this Season <br>of the Year to bring them out at your Peremptory  terms  so I <br>let him go he immedately goes up the river to <a href=#n3>Colonel Tayloe</a> what <br> their  Agreement may be I dont yet know the Ship is  gone  up <br>the Bay to Petuckson and Tayloe meets her there;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Governor </a> arrived into James river the 7th  Instant  <br>I went from home to wait upon him the 9th: the 11th the <a href=#n4>King</a> <br>was  proclaimed  I got home last night at one a Clock <a href=#n5> Captain  <br>Christain</a> came about from York into this river the 10th: is now <br>in <a href=#n6>Corotoman</a> and I am going aboard him I shall do you the <br>best Service I can in the Sale of the Slaves but I fear that will not <br>be very good I  [do not]</i> doubt I must  [be]</i> forced to Stay for a great many bills <br> until April  and Cash I am afraid will be very plenty the ship <br>I am in hopes  we  may get a freight for the number of the Slaves <br>are One hundred and Nineteen, of these but 38 men the rest women <br>and a great many boys and Girls,</p><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Sick Slaves I  fetched  home immediately <br>after <a href=#n7> Captain  Dentons</a> sailing and took the best care of them I could <br>one of them is Since Dead of whom I had hopes to make the most <br>money,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning in my Absence before I got aboard <br>the Ship  Captain  Denton Sells a woman to one Killby an Acquain<br>tance of his, for &pound;20. &pound;17 a bill of Exchange on <a href=#n8>Mr. Stark</a> of Glasgow <br>and takes a  note  of him for &pound;3 to be paid in Cash in my name <br>he is a sort of a Pilate hath been Several times by my house <br>but hath not yet brought me his money and his bills I am told <br>are not worth a <a href=#n9>groat,</a> I shall Expect Mr. Denton Shall make good <br>this loss to me pray be Expeditious in returning me the protests <br>Particularly this rascals for I Expect no other but to See it again <br>I have time to add no more but that I am</p> <br>Sir<br>Yor: very hum ble</i> Servt: -- <hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a><br><br>Although this letter is headed in the letter book, "Added to Mr. Pemberton's last Letter," it has not been possible to determine which letter Carter meant. The last letter to Pemberton of which the editor has a copy was 1727 August 23 and is marked "per the Carter." According to Carter's diary, the <i>Carter</i> sailed the next day. Accordingly, this letter must stand alone.</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Pemberton was a noted merchant of Liverpool with whomCarter did much business and to whom many of his letters are addressed.</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Thomas Nelson (1667-1745), a resident of Yorktown, was a merchant and was sheriff of York County in 1722 and 1723.

He reports a bill of exchange drawn on Stark, encloses a bill of lading (not present) for 34 hogsheads shipped on the <i>Lucia,</i> and reminds Stark that he expects his tobacco to be sold promptly because he dislikes "Dribling lagg Sales." In a post script, he requests Stark find him several tradesmen. In a post script dated July 22, 1727, he reports others bills of exchange.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>John Stark,</a> June 27 and July 22, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>  [Rappahannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>June the 27th: 1<u>727</u> <br>Mr. John Stark<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the above I have  yours  of the 27th of March <br>in which your  <S><font color="red">tell</font></S>  opinion is that I ought not to  Salkvage  for my <br> tobacco  in the <a href=#n2> Ann and Elizabeth </a> and Certainly you are in the right <br>doubt not you will See Justice done me I hope  tobacco  being so Scarce <br>my 2  hogsheads  met with no bad market when I See the Sale of 23  hogsheads  <br>I Shall be able to say whether I am pleased or no</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the  <S><font color="red">above</font></S>  bills of  exchange  to </i> <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MCB">Braxton</a> I have drawn on you <br>to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JB">Joseph  Belfield </a> for Thirty one pounds Thirteen Shillings which <br>request your payment of also.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Covers a bill of Lading for 34  hogsheads  of  tobacco  <br>on board the  Lucia  <a href=#n3> Captain  Bowman</a> which I wish to  a</i> good market <br>You have abundance of Ships here this year I reckon not many <br>of them will go out with this Fleet and therefore for your taking <br>the forward market which generally proves the best and those <br> Dribbling   lag  Sales I desire may always be avoided in my Concern <br>Hope my  tobacco  will rise well I am Sure I had most of it from good <br>Planters and not a  hogshead   <S><font color="red">fit</font></S>  is of my <a href=#n4>Quit rent </a> tobacco  <a href=#n5>Mr. Read</a> <br>was here two days ago and tells me he doubts he Shall not be able <br>to get Nickalson loaded by a hundred  hogsheads  whether I can help him <br>any thing I cant yet  <S><font color="red">foretell</font></S>  Promise  until  I have got all my <br> tobacco  home</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I intend to have Some particular goods from you <br>but have not Time now to write an Invoice Wishing you health <br>and prospertity I am </p><br>Sir -- <br>Yor: very humble Servt:<br><br>It may fall in your way to procure <br>for me the following Tradesmen. <br>A  Gardener,  a good  Taylor,  a Bricklayer <br>and a Barber Surgeon which if cannot meet with these Servants <br>at Glasgow I will have hope you may at Edinburgh or at least at <br>Dublin  Although  I have the worst Opinion of the Irish of any Country <br><br>per <a href=#n6>Bowman</a><br>Copy per Dunlap<br><br><br>Added to Mr. Starks last Letter by Bowman<br><br>Mr. John Stark<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rappahannock, July 22d: 1727<br>Sir -- <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above Entertains you with a repetition of <br>mine by  Captain Bowman I have little now to Say advise you of  another  <br>Bill Since drawn on you payable to Charles Burgess for &pound;6/ -- / -- <br>which desire your Acceptance of<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein Send you three Small bills of  exchange  to witt <br> Thomas  Berry on John Zuil for &pound;9:19:5. <a href=#n7>Henry Lee</a> on Neil <br>Buchannan for &pound;5"6" --   Alexander  Chrystils on  Charles  Miller &amp;

Rappahannock, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter had written Stark 1727 May 19, "I Sent you in a James River Ship the Ann &amp; Eliza. Mc:Clean Master 13 hhds: of Tobbo: 10 of my own and 3 of Mr. Burwells Estate. I hear the Ship was driven a Shoar in a Storm The Cargoe all Saved and the Ship like to be got of. of this I have yet no Accot: from you."</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] James Read (Reid) is not referred to as "captain" which means he was an official or factor of John Stark's firm  who was empowered to do its business in Virginia. Carter had noted that Read was aboard the <i>Charles,</i> a Glasgow ship that was owned by Stark, in a letter to Stark of 1723 September 4. </a><br><br><a name="n6">[6] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] Henry Lee (1691-1747) was a son of Carter's old friend, Hancock Kee (1653-1709). He lived in Westmoreland County at "Lee Hall" and married Mary Bland. ( Burton J.

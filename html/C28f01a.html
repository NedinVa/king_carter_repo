The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>John &amp; Betty</i> was a Liverpool ship owned by merchant John Pemberton; she often carryied slaves into the colony. In 1726 the captain was John Gale, and in the next year, she was commanded by a Captain William Denton. The ship would be lost in 1729. (<a href="Cbibl.html#">Wright.  <i>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</i>  p. 18, n. 23</a>; Carter to Pemberton, 1730 April 15; and Carter to William Dawkins, June 28, July 26, and August 22, 1727, for Denton's first name.)</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] There  were several vessels with the name <i>Rappahannock</i>. One was based in Liverpool and was commanded by a Captain Francis Etheridge in 1725; she was a 90 ton ship with 13 men. Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726 and 1727. Carter's letters mention a Captain Brackhill in 1728, and Captain Loxum in 1733.

Carter's 1732 inventory entry for this property mentions "things formerly belonging to Robert Purtell" (Pursell).

John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728.

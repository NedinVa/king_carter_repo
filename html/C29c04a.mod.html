 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Colonel [Thomas] Lee, March 4, 1729</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Colonel [Thomas] Lee of Westmoreland County, March 4, 1729, to alert him that he had written a week earlier about militia commissions and to send him condolences on the fire that had destroyed his home. Most of the letter deals with land that Lee wishes to obtain, and attempts to persuade Lee to exclude from his survey a small piece of land that would be useful to Carter and his son.</p>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Thomas Lee (1690-1750) of Westmoreland County was the son of Richard Lee II, and nephew of Edmund Jenings; he would build "Stratford," and succeed Carter on the Council. For a good article on Thomas Lee, see  that <A HREF="http://www.stratfordhall.org/thomas.html?RESEARCH">by Jeanne A. Calhoun </A>on Stratford plantation's website. ( Burton J. Hendrick.  <i>The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family.</i>  [Boston: Little Brown, 1935]. pp. 48, 51, etc.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter refers to a letter he had written to Lee <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-carter?id=C29b24a.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/web/data/users/berkeley&tag=public"target="_wblank">1729 February 24</a>.</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Carter refers to the fire that burned Lee's house at Machodoc on 1729 January 29. The <i>Maryland Gazette</i>reported that "Col. Thomas Lee's fine House in Virginia was burnt, his Office, barns, and Out-houses: His Plate, Cash (to the Sum of 1000 &pound;) Papers, and every Thing intirely lost ...."  (See the  <i>Maryland Gazette</i> for 1729 March 25-April 4</a> for the report of Lee's loss.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] James Thomas was surveyor of Lancaster County, and after 1727, of Westmoreland County. In 1736, he would be one of the surveyors involved in the work of the commission to determine the bounds of the Northern Neck proprietary. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B8">Brown.  <i>Virginia Baron. . . .</i>  pp. 83, 92. See Carter to Peter Beverley, 1727 December 14.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Francis (Frank) Awbrey (1690?-1741) was an active land speculator in the area that became Loudoun County, and was one of the first justices when Prince William County was organized in 1731. He was sheriff of that county in 1739.

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] While Carter's clerk wrote "receptall," the editor suspects that Carter may have dictated "receptacle."</a>

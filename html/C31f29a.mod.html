 Corotoman,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]
</i> <br>
<br>29 June 1731 -- <br><br>
Mr Secretary Carter<br>
 
<br>Dr Sr<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Cbiodir.html#JR">Mr. Randolph
</a>  has  sent me in his Account , there -- <br>
appears due to him from <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Colonel Page's
</a> Estate for Cash he hath ad-<br>
vanced upon our Drafts for the Service of the Estate the Sum of one  -- <br>
hundred fifty three pounds &amp; Six pence Sterling for which sum <br>
	I have signed Bills of  Exchange  upon <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr Perry.
</a> Mr Randolph promises <br>
to send  them  to you for your Hand also. He strongly pressed me to let <br>
him have these Bills to send away with <a href=#n1>Cant.
</a> I did not know  -- <br>
how to deny him, not knowing the Urgency of his Occasions  although <br>
I think we had the promises from every Body we drew to that our Bills <br>
should not go away till the  later  Ships.
</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bills of Lading for Colonel Page's  Tobacco   on Board the  -- <br>
<a href=#n2>Burwell
</a> I almost think you will be  [in]  time enough down to take  -- <br>
<a href=#n3>Camp
</a> advises me yesterday that Cant reckons to sail in eight or ten  days  <br>
I have my own Bills of Lading from him  --  I write to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JCP">Mrs Page
</a> to  -- <br>
take Care of her Husbands if you are not early enough with her to <br>
do it.  <S><font color="red">I am

</S> 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sloop made me an Extraordinary quick Trip from Stafford  -- <br>
 brought  seventy  hogsheads  of Light  Tobacco  home two  days  ago. I shall prize it as <br>
fast as I can I shall be ready for <a href=#n4>mr Cheap's
</a> sloop in a fortnight or three <br>
Week's time. You are basely served in  Westmoreland  about your fees there  --  -- <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#GT"> Captain   Turberville 
</a> is very noisy in his Endeavours to serve but I believe <br>
after all my sloop that is now there gathering up my  Tobacco 
 will hardly  -- <br>
bring any of yours  although  they have positive Orders to take in all  -- <br>
for you that will be ready I shall tell you the particulars hereafter I am 

</p>

<br><br><br>Postscript <br>
I hope Mr Cheap will allow me three shillings Sterling for the Conveniency

of my  Tobacco 
 It's what every London Master gives me on York River as well as <br>
this. I'm sure it costs me a great deal more to bring it together My people <br>
shall dispatch his Sloop in a few hours.<br>
	I would have you write a Letter of Advice of these Bills to Mr Perry,  -- <br>
I have already done it  --  tell him your will do so too  --  --  --  -- <br>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.

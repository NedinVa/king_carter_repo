Malbon  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">acknowledging</i></font></sup> your Lordships favour <br>by the same ship; &amp; am in hopes it contained the most suitable answer I was <br>capable of giving in Relation to your Lordships proposals under the Circum= <br>stances your affairs now stand, to which I desire your Lordship will be <br>pleased to be referred. The Burgesses now assembled are making <sup><font color="green">a</i></font></sup> fresh <br>Attempt against your Lordship's Grant as you will see by the  inclosed  Proceed <br>ings, which I think it my Duty to hand to Your Lordship by this first Oppor= <br>tunity. It is suggested that their last Petition to his Majesty was lost &amp; <br>never presented. How far from the Truth this is Your Lordship best knows; but <br>from what Your Lordship writes to me I must think much otherwise. They did <br>indeed miscarry in the Design of Laying out a Sum of Money for the Solliciting <br>their Petition: The Council disallowed it; But whether I shall be able to gain <br>the same point now is a great Question. Our revenue-Gentlemen  <S><font color="red">are among</font></S>   <sup><font color="green">I take to be much at the Bottom</i></font></sup> <br> <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  in raising this  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  Opposition to your Lordship's Grant, I pres= <br>ume in Hopes of Raising the Benefit of their Places upon   <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  resuming <br>it into the Hands of the Crown. This I take in a Great Measure to be the Main <br>Source of all this Stir: for sure I am the Tenants in the Northern Neck are <br>under as easy Circumstances in Respect to their Rents  <S><font color="red">as any of the</font></S>  <br> <S><font color="red">King's Subjects</font></S> , &amp; I may say have been used with a Great deal more Lenity <sup><font color="green">than any other of the King's subjects</i></font></sup><br>To my very Great Loss in the Business.

He thinks these ships will carry the last available stemmed tobacco to England before the law banning its importation goes into effect, and he reminds Perry of his promises that this tobacco would bring very good prices. He records a number of recent bills of exchange that the merchant should honor, and reminds him that the accounts he has sent do not include the &pound;180 that has been awarded by the courts in Carter's suit against John Wise's executors. He requests that accounts current be sent regularly for his own and the Burwell estate's affaiirs.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Micajah Perry,</a> January 28, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per Fowler<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy per Keiling<br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Janr. 28. 1723/4 -- <br><br>Mr. Micajh.

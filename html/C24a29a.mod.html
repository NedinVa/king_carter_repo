He also complains of Colmore's method of preparing the account current that he sent to Carter. Mr. Pratt has kept his tobacco to be sent on Wills' ship, and he adds that he is sending some more Burwell estate tobacco to Colmore in the hope that he will receive better sales this time. In a post script dated 1724 February 15, Carter lets Colmore know that the slaves' shoes the merchant has shipped were far too small for the sizes maked on them; "Your Shoomaker hath been a Arrant Cheat." He orders 6 dozen pairs to be shipped as soon as possible.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>Thomas Colmore,</a> January 29 and February 15, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per Fowler<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy per Keiling<br>Mr. Thos.

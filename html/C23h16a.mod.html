In a post script he reports the damage to the crops from bad weather and a "spot." Gloucester County seems to suffer the worst.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">[Micajah Perry],</a> August 16, 1723</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>  [Rappahannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>Augst. 16, 1723. -- <br><br>[Mr. Micajah Perry]<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a further perusal of the prints I Observe  it is   the 5 percent <br> annuities   are comprehended In the Act of Parliament mine being one of those <br>that returns me but 4 percent makes me think they are not to be bought off <br>but You know best how these things  Are, I have this day drawn upon You <br>for Seventy pound thirteen &amp; three pence to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1"> Colonel   Page</a> &amp; herein Send <br>You a first bill of his  for</i> forty nine pounds thirteen &amp; six pence I am Sir </p><br>Your most humble Servant <br><br><br>Our Crops are terribly mortified  by</i> the Continued Rains &amp; runs away with a spot <br> And we have no Weather to get it to the house which will make <br>them both Short &amp; Mean  Gloucester  County &amp; all the parts  Colonel   Page <br>is acquainted with Suffers most</i><br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a><br><br>This unheaded letter is clearly intended for Perry as he and Carter had corresponded about the annunity  often.

It, the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a><br><br><br><i>This text revised December 10, 2009.</i></a> </BODY></HTML>

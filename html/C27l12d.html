He sends two bills of exchange, one for the governor's salary and one for a portion of the fees to which Orkney is entitled, explaining that he will have Commissary James Blair review the accounts on Orkney's behalf. He solicits Orkey's support for his son Charles to succeed his brother Robert as naval officer [of the Rappahannock] when Robert moves to the Potomac. He closes the letter with comments on the selection of a successor of Nathaniel Harrison as deputy auditor of the colony.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to the Earl of Orkney, December 12, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa[hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Decembr 12. 1727<br><br>Right Honble:<br>Earl of Orkney<br> <br>My Lord<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the honor to receive two letters <br>from your Ldship of the 18th of May &amp; 31st. of Augst.

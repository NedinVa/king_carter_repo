He comments that many merchant ships have sailed from the colony without waiting for the convoys, and the colony's government has accordingly established an embargo to force the ships into convoys. He mentions the needs of the Lloyd estate and that he had hoped to be able to send an invoice for goods but circumstances have prevented him. In a lengthy post script dated July 26, 1727, Carter repeats his notice of bills of exchange of which he had notified Perry in an earlier letter, and sends (not present) a statement of Edmund Jenings's account with the Proprietors of the Northern Neck which shows a balance due Carter which he hopes will be credited against his next rent payment. He also reports Jenings's death on July 5, 1727. In a second post script dated August 22, 1727, Carter reports a bill of exchange for his daughter, Elizabeth Burwell Nicholas, and sends a bill of lading (not present) for tobacco belonging to the Lloyd estates. He notifies Perry that his grandson, Lewis Burwell, has been given permission to remain at school one more year before going to university, and that he has drawn bills on Perry payable to John Falconar and John Pemberton.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Micajah Perry,</a> June 28, July 26, and August 22,  1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>June the. 28th: 1727<br><br>Mr. Micajh: Perry<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have Said so much to you already little <br>remains now to be added herein comes an Invoice for Some goods <br>to be Sent for the Supply of <a href="Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr. Burwells</a> familys.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are also Enclosed two bills of Exchange drawn <br>upon your Self  of my own</i>  [to]</i> <a href=#n1>James Bradby</a> for Twenty four pounds &amp; <br>my own to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JB"> Doctor   Belfield </a> for Fifteen pounds with Some Seconds to witt <br><a href=#n2> William   Keiling </a> for &pound;33:7: --  my own to <a href="Cbiodir.html#RM">Richard Meeks</a> for &pound;35:-:-<br>Austin Smith for &pound;19:11: --   most</i>  <S><font color="red">All</font></S>  of the Merchants  wrote  in to their <br>Masters to come away in Fleets you particularly desire me to Exert <br>my Self in Affecting this and  proposed</i> that <a href=#n3> Captain  Pearse</a> would Accompany <br>them off from this Coast  We  found that our Ships went away as <br> <S><font color="red">fast</font></S> as they  got</i>  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>   ready  Captain  Pearse the last time he went out had <br>but Six Ships to accompany him the Government therefore came <br>to a resolution to lay a restraint the first Fleet to Sail the 30th: Instant <br>and the next the 25th: of July how many this Fleet will Consist of <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br> [I don]</i>t yet know am apt to  believe  there will be between 20 and 30 <br>Sail I hope in this wee have acted prudently and for the Service of the <br>Trade  Captain  Pearse  <S><font color="red">Expresses to the ?  utmost to See of in Safety</font></S>  now makes up his fleet at <a href=#n4> Kecoughtan </a> </i><br>and promises to be ready if possible to accompany the next,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">LLs</a> Estate if it continues in the Circumstances it <br>now is will want a Supply for the next year Intend you an Invoice <br>by the <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter </a> I have not got in the  Sheriffs  accots: and Cant tell at present <br>what the Levys and other Charges amount to therefore must refer the <br>Accot: of the Contingencies till another time I am </p><br>Sir<br>Yor: most humble Servt:<br><br>per <a href=#n5>Watkinson</a><br>Copy per <a href=#n6>Trice</a> -- <br><br><br><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to Mr. Perry Letter of the 28th. of June<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rappahannock, July 26th: 1727<br>Sir -- <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mine of the 3d: June I told you of  Several  drafts I had <br>made on you to <a href="Cbiodir.html#MCB">Colonel  Braxton </a> upon my own and Mr. Burwells Child <br>Accounts for negroes I bought to make up our mortalitys and gave you <br>advice thereof By the Bristol Ship that imported the Slaves, to witt on my <br>own Acct: for three hundred Pounds upon  your  Accot: of  Major  Burwells <br>Estate for four negroes four Score pounds upon the Accot: of <a href="Cbiodir.html#MH"> Merchants  <br>hundred</a> Estate for four negroes to be paid out of the money due upon <br>your Account   Current  in <a href=#n7>Carter Burwells</a> name four Score pounds<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have Since drawn on you on the Estates Accot: for <br>Two hundred and Fifty pounds to <a href="Cbiodir.html#ECB">Dr. Nicholas,</a> <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Colonel Page</a> hath <br>Signd the bills also<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have already advice of two bills I Sent you <a href=#n8> James  <br>Bradby</a> on your Self for &pound;24"-"-my own to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JB">Dr:  Bellfield </a> for &pound;15"-<br>on Accot: of the <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">LL Estate</a> The Seconds are under this Cover.

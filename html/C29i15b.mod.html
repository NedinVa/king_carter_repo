<br>Sepr: 15. 1729<br><br>
John Randolph Esqr<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received your favour by the <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Secretary </a> &amp; am <br>
Sorry any Thing should fall out to deprive me of the Satisfaction <br>
I should have taken in your Company however seeing your Affairs <br>
would not Allow it I am  pleased  that you take my Case so much <br>
to heart to  promise  that you will give it a deliberate Consideration <br>
In my Observations I think I was short in some things which I <br>
 believe  upon your Perusal of the papers you will hardly <br>
Slip over one is that in the Depositions of  Thomas  Carr and others <br>
that Were jury men when the line was made from the Cedar  in the law suit between <a href=#n1>Allerton</a></i> and <br>
 Newton   <S><font color="red">as</font></S> </i> were so hardly brought to agree to that Verdict do  <S><font color="red">without deposition</font></S> <br>
declare that  there was</i> no old lines  shown  to them nor any old markd tree  by Allerton</i> and <br>
that nothing Else  Induced  them to agree to that Verdict at last but the <br>
Surveys assuring them that Allerton by that Survey would have less <br>
land than his  patent  gave him and this if I remember right <br>
they all say</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are  pleased  to desire my Custom for what Cash <br>
I shall have Occasion to take up for bills of  Exchange  at the Allowance <br>
of 20 per  Cent  upon this  Encouragement  I will have one two or Three <br>
hundred pounds of you and I shall be willing to take the more if you <br>
make no scruple to take some of the bills in  Glasgow  I am 
</p>

<br>Sir <br>
 your  most  oobedient  Humble Servant.
<br><br>If I should have Occasion to draw upon you before I see  [you]  I hope <br>
you will answer my  note <br>

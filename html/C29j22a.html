<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to a senior manager, Robert Jones of Prince William County, October 22, 1729, to give him very specific instructions about the distribution of bedding, caps, and clothes for slaves on the quarters under his supervision, the breaking and training  of oxen for carts for which wheels and other gear are being sent, rounding up of hogs, cider, beef, and butter for Carter's use, and to chide Jones for his inattention to Carter's affairs.

Mr. Robert Jones<br>
 


<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Sloop I send you a great many things you have <br>
a particular invoice of them Inclosed, the Bed clothing there are Labels <br>
upon with the Names of Every Negro they are for, the bedding for the Overseer<br>
of <a href="Cbiodir.html#RF1">Richland
</a> and for the Overseer at the <a href="Cbiodir.html#MF2">Mountain
</a> are particularly  markd  <br>
the Frocks for the Children are all  markd  Also another  petty Coat  for <br>
Grace my son <a href="Cbiodir.html#CC1">Charles
</a> is very Certain that he sent one before for her knowing <br>
her to be a large Woman &amp; Cowkeeper he was particularly  Carefull  to choose <br>
a  pettyCt  for her and set her name Upon it and it was one of the  PettyCts  <br>
that the things were sow'd up in, I hope you will be more  Carefull  in the right <br>
delivery of these goods than you were in the  Cloths,  for what I Observ'd <br>
you never so much as Look'd into the Packs to see whether Everything was <br>
there <sup><font color="green">before
</i>
</font>
</sup> you sent them away so that it is in the breast of any Overseer <br>
to take What they  pleas  out and deny that they Came to them this is like <br>
the rest of the care you Use about Other things, the way us'd to be Either <br>
to have all the People down from the Several Qrs and fit them at the <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#FQ">Falls Qr:
</a> or Else to have the furthest overseers down and to open <br>
the packs before them and let them see that Every thing was right for <br>
their Gangs, this is the method I observe with <a href="Cbiodir.html#NH2">Nomini
</a> and Richland <br>
people every Overseer comes down for his peoples  Cloths  and sees <br>
that everything is right and this is the method that I Will have Observ'd <br>
By the person that lives in your Station
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent you two pr of  Wheals  with  Axtrees  Well <br>
Box'd and Well  Clampt  with Clouts Washers and  Linck  pins with an Iron <br>
to be at the End of the tongue of Each Cart 4 Chains  Yeokes  Well fitted <br>
for two teams of oxen of six in a teem  Compleat , so that you have nothing <br>
to do but to make the Carpenters make two Carts, I have Also sent you <br>
three Ropes for the managing the Oxen one  teem  I would have Broke <br>
Between <a href=#n1>Threalkild
</a> &amp; <a href=#n2>Jimmy Peters,
</a> <a href=#n3>Tim Dargon
</a> has promis' [d]  

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
me to Break a Yoke of Oxen for himself
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have agreed with an Overseer for Richland And have oblig'd <br>
him in his Conditions to Break me a Yoke of Oxen, he will Be up <br>
before christmas and I intend to send up two pr of Wheels more wth <br>
Yokes &amp; Chains &amp;ca. one for <a href=#n4>Oxford
</a> and Mountain the Other for <br>
Richland, the two first  teems  I would hope if you were a person <br>
of life &amp; resolution would be soon got ready for your use and <br>
While the Other are getting ready for you you might Break more <br>
young Oxen that might be ready for the two Carts that I intend <br>
to provide Wheels for by the next Sloop When we get these 5  teems  <br>
of Oxen  Equipt  and Well managed I think all business will go <br>
on with a great deal of Ease And Wheat &amp; Corn &amp;ca. will be Easily <br>
brought down  <S><font color="red">without
</font>
</S>  and removd from one plantation to ano<br>
ther without The sad  specticle  of Sore  backt  horses &amp; poor Jades <br>
and the people where the Plantations are large may have <br>
their fencing stuff drawn into place their Firewood got to <br>
their doors their Corn removed to their home houses their <br>
Tobo Carried from their fields  tho  never so  remoat  and abundance <br>
of other benefits not to be mention'd
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent you a Cask to put the <a href="Cbiodir.html#PQ1">poplar
</a>  Cyder  <br>
in that which I brought down pleases me and agrees <br>
with me so Extraordinary Well that I set a great Value <br>
Upon it purposely for my Own drinking therefore you <br>
will take Very great Care that it be not abus'd I think <br>
the best way will be that the Cask be Carry'd there &amp; <br>
that there the  Cyder  be drawn of from the <a href=#n5>Lees
</a> much <br>
Better than to bring it down to the Falls with

Here Carter seated the Lodge Quarter mentioned in his will."  Timothy Dargan was its overseer in 1732. ( Carl F. Cannon, Jr., "Robert ("King") Carter of "Corotoman."

<br><br><a name="n6">[6]  Norman's Ford was an important Rappahannock River (earlier Hedgeman's River) crossing on the old Iroquois trail, later called the Carolina Road. Fairfax Harrison states that it received its name because Isaac Norman patented the land in June 1726, but Carter refered to it by this name four years earlier. It is located where U.S. 29 and U.S. 15 cross the Rappahannock between Culpeper and Fauquier counties.

</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] John Hust (or Hurst) was the overseer of "Hamstead Quarter," Stafford County, in the 1732 inventory, supervising  sixteen slaves with the assistance of one horse. Hust apparently was a carpenter because Carter mentions his doing carpentry work in various letters. (<a href="Cbibl.html#A26">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."

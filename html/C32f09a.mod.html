</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes briefly to Bristol mechant John King, June 9, 1732, to report the arrival of a letter from him and complain about the "wretched" price his tobacco realized. The shortage of tobacco in the colony means some ships will not find complete cargoes and, he hopes, will raise the price.

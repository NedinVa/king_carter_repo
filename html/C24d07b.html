He alerts Randall that his daughter Elizabeth Burwell's "Imprudent Match" with Dr. George Nicholas will likely produce some law suits as he is the guardian for the Burwell children, and is acting executor of the Burwell estate. He expects Randall's assistance in these legal matters.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to [Mr. Randall], April 7, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br>Aprill the 7th: <u>17234</u>  [<i>sic</i>]</i></font></sup> <br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to your advice to my <a href="Cbiodir.html#JC1">Son</a> <br>I have  writ  to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JC3">Mr. Attorney</a> to prosecute a out --  <br>Lawry against the  Murtherer  <a href=#n1>Tho Glasscock</a> and --  <br>have told him as you are my Lawyer for the propri<br>etors business would be ready to give him you Assis<br>tance.</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Cbiodir.html#ECB">Mrs: Burwells</a> Imprudent Match with --  <br> Dotor  Nicolass It is likely may Engage me in some Law <br>Suits upon my own Accot: as I am Guardian to <a href="Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr -- <br>Burwells</a> Children And as I am his Acting Executor <br>As you are already my Lawyer I canot doubt of your --  <br>Assistance in these Affairs <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Collo: Page</a> I Expect hath al<br>ready  writ  to Engage you however having this Opor<br>tunity by <a href="Cbiodir.html#GE">Capt.

As one letter  indicates an acquaintanceship of long standing,  it has been selected as one directed to John Holloway, and this one to Randall who has not been identified.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] "William Forrester had been murdered on November 5, 1723, by Thomas Glascock whose son Gregory was named as an accessory." Carter had noted Glascock's capture in his diary on November 13th: "Collo Barber acquaints me me he had Seizd Glascocks who had fled for Murther his Estate Coll Tarpley in the behalf of Glascocks Heir offers to Enter the Land as Escheat " The lands reverted to the proprietors, and Carter apparently managed them for some years for the benefit of Glascock's heirs; he later acquired title to the properties which are mentioned in his will.

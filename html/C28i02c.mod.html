<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote to you the other day by an Exeter man <br>it was quite out of my thoughts to advise you of a bill of Exchange I <br>had drawn upon you to Colonel <a href=#n1>John Tayloe</a> for &pound;30"10. The Ship I <br>bought the Slaves out of by whom the bills were to go is not yet come <br>down <a href=#n2>our river</a> however it is necessary to be early with my advice <br><a href=#n3> Captain  Willson</a> I hope is got near you by this time I took my leave <br>of him the 23d. of July I am. </p>

<br><br>Sir<br>Your  most humble Servant <br><br>per <a href=#n4>Dunlop</a><br>

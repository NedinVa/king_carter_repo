<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, July 9 and August 7, 1731, to inform him of a bill of exchange. In a longer postscript dated August 7, 1731, Carter complains bitterly about Stark's poor sales and management of his affairs, and informs the merchant that he has explained his complaints to Captain Bowman of the <i>Lucia
</i> from whom Stark is to get the details. Nevertheless, Carter is shipping more tobacco on the <i>Lucia
</i> and encloses a bill of lading (not present).

</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">1[] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.
</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage." From this letter, it appears that the <i>Lucia
</i> probably was owned by Stark.

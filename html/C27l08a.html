He is not sure whom the governor will support, and notes that Horace Walpole will make the appointment.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#RC">Robert Cary,</a> December 8, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Decr: the 8th. 1727<br><br>Mr. Robt: Cary<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Small  Vessell  belonging to  Bristol  that loaded high <br>up <a href=#n1>our river</a> and is unexpectedly come down to clear out gives the Opportun<br>ity of this Short line to Advise you of the receipt of yours by Buckler, <a href=#n2>Bradby</a> <br> <S><font color="red">in the Spotswood is also Arrived</font></S> , <a href=#n3>Keeling</a> and <a href=#n4>Brooks</a> are <sup><font color="green">also</i></font></sup> in  <S><font color="red">Peankytank</font></S>  what <br>more Ships to the Southward I dont yet hear  <S><font color="red">Coll Harr</font></S> </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Cbiodir.html#NH">Colonel Harrison</a> our <sup><font color="green">Deputy</i></font></sup> Auditor is lately dead it is  talkt  <br>that Several will be Solicitous for his place who our <a href="Cbiodir.html#WG">Govr.</a> will put in in <br>his room or use his Interest for is not come to my knowledge, I am apt to <br>think if <a href="Cbiodir.html#JC1">my Son</a> the Secretary <sup><font color="green">had</i></font></sup> hopes of Success he would be one among the <br>number perhaps it may be Said the place he has already is favour Enough <br>for him but that you know was the Effects of his money and is not so  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">profit</i></font></sup><br>able a place as it is reckond by a great many I have no manner of In <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S> <br>timation of his Inclinations about it nor what his Interest may be at Court <br>My Lord Carteret Seems to be the favourite of his discourse who our Govr.<br>thinks proper to recommend will go near to carry it I Suppose,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wee  have a Ship will be ready to leave us in about 8 or 10 <br>Days by her  <S><font color="red">th</font></S>  Expect will be Several Letters about this Affair whether there <br>be any by this  Vessell  may be a Question This place is in the Gift of Mr. <a href=#n5>Horace <br>Walpole</a> <sup><font color="green">Auditor of the Plantations</i></font></sup> I Shall leave it here and remain </p><br>Sir --  <br>Yor: most humble Servt. -- <br><br>per the  Western Snow <br>Berry <a href=#n6>Danzay</a> &amp; <a href=#n7>Holladay</a> are arrived<br>Copy per <a href=#n8>Christian</a><br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad.

<br>Honl Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having lately met with some fresh testimony to the <br>boundary of the Northern neck in proof of the Southern run of the <br><a href=#n1>Little forks
</a> being incomparatively the larger and longer stre [a] m <br>from Mr <a href=#n2>Thomas Owsley
</a> I cannot but think it Proper immedia<br>tely to hand it to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JH">Mr Holloway
</a> and it will not be Unpleast to you <br>who Always Appear So Strenuously my Friend to send you a Copy <br>of it taking all the Proofs I have together  <S><font color="red">I think
</font>
</S>  it appears to <br>me it will be as easy disputing against daylight as to dispute the <br>Little fork out of the Northern Neck Grant this relation of Ows<br>leys if you are at the Oyer &amp; terminer as I strongly hope you will <br>be Able to be I should be willing <a href="Cbiodir.html#JC1">my son
</a> should see And if you think <br>it Proper to let <a href="Cbiodir.html#JR">Mr Attorney
</a> have A Sight of it it may Perhaps a <br>little Cool him in respect to the great Zeal of Mr <a href="Cbiodir.html#JG2">Recr Genl

</a>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty warmth of Our Recr: I was of Opinion <br>proceeded from his Strong Inclination to have the Northern neck <br>added to his Place (A pretty  Perquisit  if he could get it) but there <br>is lately come into my head Another reason that I apprehend may <br>greatly kindle <sup><font color="green">the fire of
</i>
</font>
</sup> his Zeal yo: know some years agoe I lent <br><a href=#n3>Harry Willis
</a> some money this money as I take it was paid me by <br>Colo Grymes who is Also guardian to <a href=#n4>young Smith
</a> I have a <br>Notion that all the land and Slaves that Willis has in this Fork <br>are mortgaged to Colo Grymes for his security and the boys <br>if it be so as I  beleive  you know more of it than I do 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
the  Mistery  of his mighty warmth is Pretty well Unfolded &amp; <br>Colo  <S><font color="red">judge
</font>
</S>  Grymes  Cann't  be look'd Upon as an indifferent  Council  <br>for the King in this Affair or that the duty of his place is his only <br>motive
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Grants have Yet Pass'd for land in this little fork <br>I take <a href="Cbiodir.html#WG">the Govr
</a> to have been Surprized into for I can't believe if it <br>was Clearly prov'd to a govr: that the Southern branch is the main <br>branch he would sign Any  Pattents  for lands in this little fork
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't Expect there will be much done at this oyer and <br>terminer you know how uneasy it is for me to be Abroad in this <br>hot season And <a href=#n5>our Court
</a> will happen the day after where I <br>have Urgent business I have Excus'd myself for some late years <br>from attending these Courts in respect to their Unseasonableness <br>And I hope I shall not Suffer by my Absence now
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n6>Robin Beverley
</a> got a  Pattent  of <a href=#n7>Colo Spotswood
</a> for <br>four thousand Acres in which he Cunningly leaves out the mea<br>sure of some of his Courses and by this means wins into this little Fork  <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S> <br> <S><font color="red">told
</font>
</S>  upon a late  tryal  Made by <a href=#n8>Will Beverley
</a> his son being threatened <br>to it by the Recr Genl. there appears to be near ten thousand Acres <br>this Upper part of his  Pattent  taking in the little fork he hath <br>seated with Two or three qrs: and Slaves so that its likely that <br>interest will Also be engaged in the Controversy however the plain<br>ness of the Case I can't but think will Overcome all difficulties

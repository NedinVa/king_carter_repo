</a><br><br> This letter precedes another of this date in the letter bookon the same theme.
</a> <br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of"Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than"Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especiallyto merchants abroad. The return address, county, and state have beenadded for clarity to this unheaded letter.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter often referred to in theiryouth as his "Cozns." Ralph Wormeley (<i>ca.
</i>1681-1714), Ralph Wormeley's (d.1701) oldest son; and John Wormeley(1689-1727) because their parents were his brother-and sister-in-law. He was one of the boys' trustees under their father'swill.

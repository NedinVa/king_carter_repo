Thus you see how little reason there is<br>to make the Saponies accountable for the action of these -- <br>Renegades, who, as they  join'd  the Cattabawas against the<br>will of their nation, are now no longer in their power<br>either to be punished or delivered up by them: I must also<br>in justice to the Saponies inform you that, tho' they think<br>they have had just cause to make war on the Tuscaruroes<br>for the loss of so many of their men killed by that nation<br>last winter, yet they absolutedly refused to join the Cattabaws<br>in attacking Blounts Town as was proposed to them, declaring<br>they would not rest contented with such satisfaction as this -- <br>Government should think fit to obtain of the Tuscarures<br>rather than transgress the orders they had received from<br>hence, by taking a revenge of their own, and this may<br>serve to convince the Maherines of the peaceable  dispositn <br>of the Saponies, and how far that nation has been from -- <br>assisting the Cattabaws in the mischief they have -- <br>done.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Maherine boy taken prisoner Collo Harrison<br>in his Conference with some of the Chiefs of that party<br>who took him insisted on his being restored, and  threatned <br>them with the resentment of this Governmt: in case it<br>were either refused or delayed, but the boy being some time<br>before sent away to the Cattabaw Town, all that could<br>be obtain'dwas a promise from the King of the Sagars<br>Indians that as soon as he got home the boy should be<br>sent to Colo Harrisons; so that if any credit is to be -- <br>given to the promise of this Indian King, the Maherines<br>may soon expect the return of this prisoner, if not they<br>will see how ready this Government is to do them good offices<br>even without their application.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This you will be pleased to represent to the Maherines as a<br>proof of our inclination  <S><font color="red">to do ther</font></S>  gratify them in any thing that<br>is reasonable, and I hope they will not insist upon what is<br>otherwise, as is that of their demand of  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>  satisfaction -- <br><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br>from a nation that has no ways injured them.</p><br><br><br><br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> State Records, Colonial Government (RG-1), Colonial Papers, 1630-1778, Library of Virginia, Richmond.

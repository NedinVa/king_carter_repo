<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will hope this will meet you in a better state <br>
of health than you have been for some time. As you are con <br>
cern'd in all <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1">colo Pages</a> other Affairs, so I think you the properest<br>
person to be Consulted in the method necessary for the settling<br>
of the <a href=#n1>mine Adventure</a> which hitherto lies in crude preparatory<br>
Articles only: You have herewith a Copy of all the Agreements that are<br>
Subsisting between us My Sons <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#RC2">Robert</a> &amp; <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#CC1">Charles</a> have given their<br>
consent to the last Articles sign'd between Colo page &amp; I, Deeds for all<br>
the lands mention'd in this Agreement were pass'd in my Son Roberts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name

before Colo Pages death; We have now Six miners sent into us upon<br>
Sterling wages, likewise a Smith, some of them came in in Colo pages<br>
life time, some since. <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JC1">The Secretary</a> I take to be now the Proper person<br>
to personate in the behalf of Colo: Pages Widow, &amp; Children, I write<br>
to him a letter to be Lodg'd with you; until his coming to William <br>
 sburgh  in his way hither; which he proposes early in the next month:<br>
It seems highly Expedient  <S><font color="red">to me</font></S>  this affair should have a Speedy &amp; full<br>
 <S><font color="red">settlement</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">regulation -- </i></font></sup> My son Robert went from hence this day with intentions<br>
to be here again when his brother Comes; My Son Charles does the same<br>
And it is my present resolution then to go Through with this Affr:<br>
There has been no Account Settled yet of the Respective Charges we<br>
have Severally been at Since the beginning of the Undertaking: The Assis-<br>
tance of a Lawyer will be absolutely Necessary for us to have; I hope the in <br>
closed Contents will  sett  the matter in so good a light to you, that you<br>
<sup><font color="green">may</i></font></sup>  [[be]]  enabled to draw proper Instruments, that will be obliging in the law<br>
for all the Necessary Purposes to this Settlement to be Executed by us<br>
at our meeting: These rough instruments I would willingly have prepared  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S> <br>
that  <S><font color="red">my son</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">the Secretary</i></font></sup> may bring them along with him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heartily wish you a full return of your health &amp; am --  --

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page, organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful.

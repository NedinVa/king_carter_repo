Carter understands that, although Chelton and others had had surveys for land in the area made in 1714, and had presented them to Thomas Lee, then the proprietors' agent, they and Lee had differed about the details and "deeds" were not issued. He tells Chelton that he cannot become involved with the dispute with Lee. He would do a disservice to others who have had patents in the area since, and to the proprietors who have had no rents, were he to issue patents for these lands. He tells Chelton that since he became the agent, he has issued orders to the surveyors to look for the best lands there for his children, and that John Savage is preparing the survey since John Copege's death. He has refused George Mason's application for lands in the area, and will refuse all other until "I am served." He promises to assist Chelton once his own surveys are completed, and sends Chelton three warrants (not present), reminding Chelton of the fees due for them.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>John Chelton,</a> [April 6, 1724]</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br><br>Mr. Jno.

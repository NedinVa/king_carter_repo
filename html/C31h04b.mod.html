<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Thistle</i> was a London ship commanded by a Captain Reid and owned by merchant James Buchanan. (See  Carter to Edward Athawes, 1731 September 10, and Carter to James Buchanan, 1731 November 19.</a>) </a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al. </i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. </i> </a> pp. 236-39.)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See Carter to William Dawkins, and Carter to Falconar's executors, both 1730 April 16, for Falconar's death date.  Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Spotswood</i> was a  London ship commanded by James Bradby,  1727-1732, and was owned by Micajah Perry.  ( Adm 68/195, 70r ff., found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter to Micajah Perry 1730 April 16.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</a>

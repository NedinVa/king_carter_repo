He reminds Perry that he  often has large sums of Carter's money in his hands and therefore has no grounds for complaining of Carter's account having none. He complains about Perry's failure to credit Carter with tobacco shipped by John Bolling to several merchants on Carter's account, and alerts Perry that he has been suing merchant Harry Offly for several years for debts. Perry's handling of the accounts for the estate of Nathaniel Burwell, Carter's son-in-law, are not satisfactory. He lists a number of bills of exchange that he has drawn both on his own and on the Burwell accounts. The lengthy letter ends with comments upon the Northern Neck case noting that he will stand the cost of another opinion from the Attorney General since Colonel Cage will not pay for it.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Micajah Perry,</a> May 17, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa [hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>May 17th 1727<br><br>Mr. Micajh: Perry<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now upon yor: Accots: in your Sales of my <br>60 hhds: per <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Graves</a> in 1725 Twenty one of them is sold to Inland Cus<br>tomers in the Sale of the 47 hhds: by <a href=#n1>Keeling</a> Thirty of them went also <br>to Inland Customers fifty one in the whole  upon these you allow <br>me no discounts I have demonstrated this matter to you largely <br>but you  [aff]</i>ord me no Answer and delight in very Short Letters <br>I shall  [be]</i> as Short in plainly  <S><font color="red">tell</font></S> letting you know untill you give <br>me Credit for the Discounts of these two Parcells of  tobacco  I shall Cease <br>to give you any more of the trouble of my  tobacco   The  tobacco  in Keeling <br>you Sold quickly after it got home and yet you have a Salvo in yor: <br>Acct: Currt: dated the 21st: of January following [when outstanding <br>Debts are come in &amp; which is what I never Saw in an Accot: of yours <br> <S><font color="red">before </font></S>  <i>till now</i></i> nor your familys before you] I reckon my ballance is in<br>tirely in your hands and you will have the Advantage of a great <br>deal of my money a much longer time  than  you can say I was <br>out of Cash for any of my  tobacco  for this reason if there was no other <br>I think you ought to Credit me for my discounts In yor: Acct: Currt: <br>you place to me &pound;3:8:I allowed to <a href=#n2>Colonel Bolling</a> for his Commission <br>I see no reason for it Colonel Bolling no doubt drew his commission here <br>I must tell you this  Story  I have been  Suing  these Several <br>Years for the debt <a href=#n3>Harry Offly</a> owed me Colonel Bolling ships 56 hhds: <br>to the Randolphs in the  Williamsburgh  8 in the  Sea Horse  3 in Turner <br>to the Same Gentleman and 23 in the   Micajah   to your Self <br>the produce of all these 90 hhds: to be paid into your hands on my <br>Accot: <a href=#n4>Isham Randolphs</a> and  <S><font color="red">Daytons ?</font></S>  Deighton bills of Lading I have.

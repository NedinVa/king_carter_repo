<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Thomas, Lord Fairfax, bthe proprietor of the Northern Neck, July 16, 1730, to apprise him of the challenges to the proprietary being mounted in the colony, and to send him (not present) a copy of the recent statement of complaints against the proprietary prepared by the colony's House of Burgesses. Carter notes his shock at learning that the former lieutenant governor, Alexander Spotswood, has been making statements that Carter has no authority to make grants of land in the  proprietary which authority he notes he has always had from the several proprietors for whom he  has been agent or lessee. Carter reports that the leader of the opposition is John Grymes, the colony's receiver general, and that Grymes and his supporters are well financed.

<br>July 16, 1730<br><br>
To the Lord Fairfax<br>
 
<br>My Lord.<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did myself the honour on the 18th of June<br>
to Acquaint your Lordship  of
</i> the Attempt our house of Burgesses<br>
was making upon your Lordships Estate in the Northernneck   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i><br>
and that upon the petition of some Dutchmen who desire to remove<br>
with their  families  from Newyork   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> an order has lately been made<br>
in Council to grant large  quantities  of Land above and about<br>
 Shenandoah  a large branch of  Potomac  River dividing<br>
MaryLand from the Northern Neck against this order I had the<br>
permission of <a href="Cbiodir.html#WG">the Governour
</a> to enter a Caveat which was all I could do
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house of Burgesses have set forth their<br>
complaints against the Grant in a long petition to the king in<br>
Council expecting thereby to bring the grant upon  Trial  the most<br>
considerable men in the Northern neck are strenuous  enemies s <br> 
to the Grant. <a href="Cbiodir.html#JG2"> Colonel  Grymes
</a> our receiver General heads  them
</i> and openly de <br>
clares he will use his utmost interest to bring the grant upon  Trial  &amp;<br>
seems very sure he shall be Able to Carry his Point that your Lordship<br>
may be  apprized  of this petition I send you now a Copy of it by the first<br>
Opportunity under <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr: Perrys
</a> Cover who after perusal I request to<br>
Expedite it to  Your  Lordships hands one of their main complaints is<br>
that under the grants of  your  Lordships agents the Grantees have<br>
no security in the title to their Lands And <a href=#n1> Colonel  spotswood
</a>  has <br>
told a great many and to my self also he heard your Lordship say<br>
You had given no power to me to grant Away any Lands 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>
which  shocked  me very much considering  your  Lordships power is re <br>
corded in our general Court and was sent me in at my taking the<br>
first  Lease  and  Colonel  Spotswood adds that Your Lordship said you had<br>
good advice I had no power to grant Lands under my  Lease  if it be<br>
so what a  prodigious  wound would this be to  your   <S><font color="red">Lordships
</font>
</S>  Estate &amp;<br>
what just reason the Grantees would have to go into Complaints  I shall Submit to
</i>    your  Lordships consideration
</i> my <br>
power from  your  Lordship &amp; <a href="Cbiodir.html#WC"> Colonel  Cage
</a> is the same that I had from <a href=#n2>my Lady<br>
Fairfax
</a> and before her from My Lady Culpeper and my Lord Fairfax<br>
And all the agents that have been in the Execution of the Grant<br>
from the beginning have Acted under the same power in granting<br>
away the Lands in Fee simple and has now been practiced <br>since the year  [omission in text]
</i> when <a href="Cbiodir.html#PL"> Colonel  Ludwell
</a> began his agency and<br>
from the first appearance of the grant here<br>
before him I believe  <S><font color="red">a Considerable time
</font>
</S>  another great foundation of com <br>
plaint  has  been your Lordships  lease  to the Bristol men -- giving them<br>
power to dig up your tenants Land 5 miles round their own Land<br>
after copper ore when every Tenant have a right in those ores by their<br>
Grant but  Your  Lordship will be best acquainted with the Nature of the<br>
Complaints from the Petition
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house of Burgesses went into resolve to give<br>
&pound;150  sterling  out of the Countrys money to Solicit this Petition  <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S>  this<br>
resolve came up <a href=#n3>to the Council
</a> but they would not Concur in it so it  dropped <br>
the petition was  <S><font color="red">sent illegible
</font>
</S>   presented
</i> to the Governour who has the Care of transmitting<br>
it to his  Majesty  however the Advocates of this Petition  missed  of this<br>
money they are gentlemen of such strength and have so much<br>
Zeal in the Matter that I am  doubtful   Your  Lordship must expect money<br>
will not be Wanting I have done  Your  Lordship the best service I could <br>
in this affair and have had the Advice of our best Lawyers for my<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direction

</b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.
</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Alexander Spotswood (1646-1740) had been the lieutenant governor from 1710 to 1722, and had remained in the colony after his term.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Propietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] There is no explicit discussion of the Council of the resolution of the House of Burgesses to appropriate the money, but on 1730 June 17 the Council did approve the petitions of the persons from other colonies that Carter notes at the beginning of this letter. There is a brief discussion of the controversy over the western boundaries of the proprietary in Charter VIII of Stuart E. Brown's <i>Virginia Baron.

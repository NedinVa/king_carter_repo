<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 18 hogsheads on  board   Ditto  ship   [tobacco mark]  I consign  to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1">Mr. Perry</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My 4 hogsheads on board the <a href=#n4>Carolina</a>  Captain  Holladay,  [tobacco mark]  I consign to  Mr. Perry</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My 30 hogsheads in the <a href=#n5>Amity</a>  Captain Wills  [tobacco mark]  I consign to Mr. Falconar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 17 hogsheads of <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MH">Merchant Hundreds</a> on board the <a href=#n6> Micajah  &amp;  Phillip</a><br>
 [tobacco mark]  I consign to Mr. Falconar -- <br>
_______________________________________________________________________________

<br><br>Now follows how the Estates  Tobacco  is to be  Consigned </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 15 hogsheads on board the  Carolina   Captain Holloday., 10 of this mark  [tobacco mark]  5 <br>
of this mark  [tobacco mark]    I consign to Mr. Perry. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 16 hogsheads on board the <a href=#n7> Spotswood </a>  Captain  Bradby, 11 of this  [tobacco mark] <br> 2 of this mark  [tobacco mark]  3 of this mark  [tobacco mark]  I consign to Mr. Perry -- </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 9 hogsheads on board the   Micjaah  and Phillip  of this  mark  [tobacco mark]  I consign  to Mr. Perry</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12 hogsheads on board the  Amity   Captain  Wills.. of this mark  [tobacco mark]  I con<br>=sign to Mr. Falconar -- </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 20 hogsheads in the <a href=#n8> Burwell </a>  Captain  Cant I consign to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr. Dawkins</a>  [tobacco mark] </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking the bills of Lading you are to fill them up thus. My own <br>
 Tobacco   Shipped  by me upon my proper Account  and  risk.  The Merchant <br>
hundreds  Tobacco   shipped  by me upon the Accot: and  risk  of the Merchant <br>
hundreds Estate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estates  Tobacco  the bills of Lading to be  filled  up  shipped  by <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1">Mann Page</a><br>
 Esquire  and my Self  Executors  of <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr. Burwell</a>  Deceased  upon the Proper Account  and <br>
 risk  of Major  Nathaniel  Burwells Estate -- </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These directions are so Plain that I think you can't go wrong <br>
I expect you will have time after you have taken these bills of Lading to <br>
send them to me that I may send them in Letters by the respective ships but <br>
if it happens Otherways, you may either deliver the bills of Lading to Colonel<br>
Page requesting him in my name to send one of them to the Merchants <br>
they are  Consigned  to in the Ship the  Tobacco  is in rather  than  fail you must <br>
send a bill of Lading to each  Merchant  by the proper ship, Acquainting the <br>
Merchants that you do this by my Order. but I had much rather that 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
either Colonel Page or my Self have the bills of Lading -- </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href=#n9>Impost and Cocquet</a> for these  Tobaccos  is due to the Masters <br>
upon their Signing the bills of Lading but I beleive they will be well enoug [h] <br> satisfied  that it be  mentioned  in the bills of Lading the Impost and  Cocquet  not<br>
being paid</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Captain  Wills I am indebted to for a knot of <a href=#n10> Hamburg  line</a> <br>
and he sent me a  barrel  of strong Beer what he will charge for it I don't <br>
know he owes me by promise 30/ sterling for 10 hogsheads of  Tobacco  I delivered <br>
his sloop at my own house which I had been at Considerable Charge in <br>
bringing home. You are to get this money of him after his Account  --  is <br>
paid or to discount it in my Impost either way as he pleas's -- </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Nelmes Account  I think is right I did not know from <br>
whom I had the  Molasses  I would have you pay him his ballance</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already told you I am in  Captain  Bradbys Debt and <br>
directed you to get his Account  and Send it me that I may order you to <br>him or if you pay him within orders it will be as well for I am not <br>
in the least Suspicious that he will be ingenerous in  overcharging  <br>
me for any thing more than he would do if he and I were together <br>
in Settleing in the Account  --  </p>

<br><br> The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft. </a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11.   <i>Virginia Tax Records.</i>  [Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, Inc., 1983.] p. 539.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. ( "Notes and Queries."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.</i>  2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See Carter to William Dawkins, and Carter to Falconar's executors, both 1730 April 16, for Falconar's death date.  Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] William Holladay commanded a ship named the <i>Princess Carolina.</i> ( Survey Report 6800, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <i>Booth</i> in 1723-1724, and the <i>Amity,</i> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary for June 1723.  ( Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194, and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] The Micajah &amp; Philip was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal." ( Adm. 68/194-196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia</a>; and   <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.</i>  26[1918]: 172, abstracting the Jones Papers at the Library of Congress.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] This London ship was commanded by James Bradby, 1727-1732.  (Adm 68/195, 70r ff., found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.)</a>


<br><br><a name="n8">[8] Constantine Cant was the captain of the <i>Burwell.</i> ( Survey Report 6800 for Adm. 68/195, ff. 76v, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n9">[9] The impost was the duty imposed by Britain on imported tobacco, and the cocket (for which a fee was charged) was the certified document issued that the impost had been paid.</a>

<br><br><a name="n10">[10] The German city of Hamburg was noted for the production of rope, and this may be what Carter means. </a>

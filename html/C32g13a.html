The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter first mentions this vessel in a letter to Foster Cunliff of 1731June 24, noting that a Captain Fowler commanded her. Other mentions in letters to Cunliff and John Pemberton, both Liverpool merchants, indicate that probably was the vessel's home port.</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Landon Carter (1710-1778) was Carter's seventh child by his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis. Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary. A reproduction of a portrait of him may be found on the website of the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-carter?id=http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/robert_carter.html.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/web/data/users/berkeley&tag=public" target="_wblank"></a> Foundation of Historic Christ Church.

He and Richard Gildart undertook "a major reorginization of business with Maryland and Virginia . . . beginning in the early 1720's [they] sent numerous factors to the region." They established stores in which retail goods were sold, purchased the produce of the region, had it ready for loading when ships arrived, and also moved into the sale of slaves. ( James A.

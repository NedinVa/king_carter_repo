He continues with a discussion of land that he has wished to buy for many years from Robert Cary of London. He reminds Perry that this Hull property had formerly belonged to his deceased niece, and that the dispute over the ownership had been appealed to the Virginia Council where Carter lost. He had then negotiated with Cary through his son John (when John was studying law in London) but Cary wanted &pound;2,000 which Carter thought too much. He understands from John that Cary might be willing to sell lfor &pound;1,000. If so, he instructs Perry to buy the property if Cary can give him a clear title.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Micajah Perry,</a> September 30, 1723</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa [hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>Septr: the 30th: <u>1723</u> <br>Mr. Micaja Perry<br> <br><u>Sr</u><br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herewith I send you Six first Bills of Ex [c]</i>hange <br> William  Makdougall on  William  Anderson and Company for &pound;41 pounds <br><a href=#n1> Colonel  Spotswood</a> on  John  Cary for &pound;77:14  shillings :0: <a href=#n2>Henry Fitzhugh</a> <br>on <a href=#n3>Arthur Lee </a>for &pound;24:18  shillings :6  pence   John  Sharp on  John  Sharp for <br>&pound;4:0  shillings :0  pence : James Makine on Henry McCall for &pound;3:6:0: <br> Robert  Carter on Mr: Perry for &pound;15:0:0 Amounting in <br>the whole to One hundred Sixty five pound Eighteen Shillings and <br>Sixpence of which desire your Management</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if any of them will not be paid pray let me have <br>them Exeditiously returned  <S><font color="red">to me</font></S> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn Over</p><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>If you will please to give yourself the trouble <br>to  overhaul  some of my late Letters you will find for Some Years <br>I have been In treaty with <a href=#n4>Mr. Cary</a> for the Land he recovered <br>under the Title of Hull the Great Uncle of my Brothers Daughter <br><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#ECL"> Elizabeth Lloyd </a> who last died  seized  from these Lands in the  trial <br>a great dispute arose  whether   Robert  Hull under whom Mr. <br>Cary claims was Brother to the whole Blood to  John  Hull the <br>Grandfather of my Niece the point was so nice the Court was <br>equally divided  until  it came to  Colonel Spotswood who gave his <br>judgment in favour of Mr. Cary, there are some that are in <br>possession of some of this Land yet hold out it is now said Mr. <br>Cary hath got fuller proofs for his title under  Robert  Hull, I <br> employed  <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JC1">my Son</a> in this Affair to whom Mr. Cary promised the <br> refusal  of this Land but after his Demands were nothing less <br> than  Two Thousand pounds whereupon I declined all further <br>thoughts about the Matter, My Son Acquaints me by the last <br>discourse he had with Mr. Cary he believes he would part wth: <br>them for one Thousand Pounds My request to you  is you  <S><font color="red">woud</font></S>   will</i> <br>renew this Treaty again and to let me know how he stands Incli<br>ned if he can make out a clear Title I  believe  I may adventure <br>at the purchase at a Thousand pounds If you think it proper <br>to give yourself the Trouble of this Affair you will oblige </p><br><u>Sr </u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your most humble Servt:<br><br>My Son is  entering  upon the State of Matrimony <br>the 3d of next Month is the day set I have <br>already said Enough to you about the <br>Shortness of our Crops<br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

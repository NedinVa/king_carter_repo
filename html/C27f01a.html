Because, as he adds, "charity begins at home," he sends Cary an account of his debt due from Evans, and asks Cary to attempt to collect it, noting that he will send a power of attorney by a London ship as soon as he can. He regrets the damage to his tobacco shipped by the <i>Mansel</i> but hopes Cary will find an "Advantageous Sale" for it.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#RC">Robert Cary,</a> June 1, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>June the 1st: 1727<br><br>Mr. Robert Cary<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yors:  of the. 10th: of March came to my hands two days <br>ago.

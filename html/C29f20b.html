<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] William Holladay commanded a ship named the <i>Princess Carolina.</i> ( Survey Report 6800, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] This London ship was commanded by James Bradby, 1727-1732.  ( Adm 68/195, 70r ff., found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The Micajah &amp; Philip was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal." ( Adm. 68/194-196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia</a>; and   <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography.</i>  26[1918]: 172, abstracting the Jones Papers at the Library of Congress.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Isham Randolph was captain of the London ship <i>Williamsburgh</i> in 1725-26, and Charles Rogers commanded her in1727-28. ( Admiralty 68/194, ff. 39v, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant  Alderman [Micajah] Perry,May 12, 1732, to report the arrival of a number of letters and accounts by several ships concerning his own and the affairs of the Burwell and Page estates. He asks the merchant to consider a discount  on some transactions, and is pleased to  have the final deeds for the purchase of the Lloyd estate although there may problems obtaining acceptance in the colonial courts whose standards are different from those in England. The charges of the British lawyer who handled the Lloyd transaction are far greater than he had expected but must be paid. Comments about local matters including payment of debts such as those of Dr. George Nicholas and tobacco shipments follow. He thanks Perry for writing that his grandson, Lewis Burwell, has survived the small pox and for nice comments about Burwell, but adds that it would have been nice if Burwell had bothered to write to his mother and grandfather.

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeds of Conveyance for the Investing me with a <br>Title of <a href=#n4>Lloyds virginia Estate

There is mention of a fine to be levied <br>which I suppose Mr. Snell will take Care to send me which our lawyers <br>Say they think will Cure all defects Mr. Snells bill of Charges is <br>an Afterclap I never dreamt of I am altogether unfit to say whether <br>it be right or no it is a very large bill the affair has been a long time <br>upon the Anvil if I remember right in some of my Accots Currt. I <br>have already paid some law Charges it proves a very dear purhcase to <br>me especially in these poor times for tobacco however I must Acknowle= <br>dge your pains and trouble in bringing it to an issue  hath  no <br>doubt been very perplexing and I am fully of the  beleif  if you <br>could have Made it cheaper you would Mr. Snell if he will make no <br>abatement must I think be paid and I am thankful to you for <br>Your good Wishes that I may live in the enjoyment of this Estate <br>long enough to retrieve all these pull backs

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Bailey
</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;
</a> A letter of Carter's to Dawkins 1732 May 12 refers to "your ship Bailey." as does a letter of 1738 May 10 from Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10.)
</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The Phoenix apparently was a London vessel for she is recorded as having paid the required sixpence fee in London in December 1732. ( Survey Report 68.2 summarizing Adm. 68/196, from the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] The <i>Spotswood
</i> was a  London ship commanded by James Bradby,  1727-1732, and was owned by Micajah Perry.  ( Adm 68/195, 70r ff., found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See Carter to Micajah Perry 1730 April 16.
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] This plantation apparently lay up the Rappahannock near the falls as Carter always sent his sloop for its tobacco. Carter was involved with the Lloyd estate, which was that of John Lloyd, husband of his niece Elizabeth. The estate's tobacco mark was the double arrowhead or double "L" which Carter frequently uses in his diary and letters to refer to it. He undertook to buy the Lloyd estate in the later years of his life, and finally acquired it about 1731.
</a><br><br><a name="n5">[5] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.
</a><br><br><a name="n6">[6] The <i>Rebecca 
</i> was probably a London ship; she was of 300 tons, had a crew of 11, and was commanded by Samuel Malbon in 1731-32. ( Adm. 65/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a>)
</a><br><br><a name="n7">[7] The Micajah &amp; Philip was a large vessel of some 400 tons carrying a crew of 27. The captain's name varies from record to record as James Bradley or James Bradby. Thomas Jones wrote to his wife, then in England, concerning this ship in 1728, "The Micajah &amp; Philip that comes to James River is as good as the best Ships that Comes hither, but Bradby the master seems to be a little conceited and prodigal."

</a><br><br><a name="n8">[8] Carter may refer to Samuel Haswell, a London Assurance director in Suffolk Lane, and a member of Haswell and Brooks which was a London firm listed in 1740 directories of that city.

</a><br><br><a name="n9"> [9] A bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest.  It is used primarily in international trade, and is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a specific date sometime in the future.  If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft.  If it is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft.  Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a draft, but whereas a draft is always negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true of a bill of exchange. ("Dictionary of Financial Scam Terms." http://www.fraudaid.com/Dictionary-of-Financial-Scam-Terms/bill_of_exchange.htm. 8/22/2005)<br><br><a name="n10">[10] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.
</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See Carter to William Dawkins, and Carter to Falconar's executors, both 1730 April 16, for Falconar's death date.

He was also involved in the transport of felons to Maryland and Virginia.  Some of the time he was a partner with Isaac Hobhouse in ship voyages.  He had an interest in a glasshouse.  He served as Sheriff, Mayor, and Alderman of the City of Bristol."  ("Germanna History Notes." http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~george/johnsgermnotes/germhs79.html. 8/23/06)

He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and inherited considerable property, living at "Fairfield," Gloucester County. He would be president of the Council in 1750-1751.

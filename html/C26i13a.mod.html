<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy
consulted:</b></i></b> This document is privately owned, and its owners
prefer to remain anonymous. </a><br><br>

<br><br>The document was folded and addressed on a blank portion of
the obverse leaf: "For his Majesty's Service | To | The Sherif of the
County of --  | Prince George." It was endorsed, presumably by the
clerk of Prince George County, "Proclamation | continuing Officers |
August 1726 --  | Published Sept. 13th 1726." It bears a very
large original signature of Robert Carter as is noted by the use of
italics. The document has been framed for many years, and there are
some wrinkles along the right side that prevent a clear reading of
several words.</a>

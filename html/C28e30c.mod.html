</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Glasgow merchant John Stark, May 30, 1728, to report the arrival of goods and accounts, and to complain of certain of Stark's accounting methods. He informs Stark of several bills of exchange, and then seeks the merchant's support of the colony's effort to obtain repeal of the act prohibiting the importation of stemmed tobacco into Britain. In a lengthy post script dated July 9th, Carter encloses bill s of lading, complains of Stark's holding his tobacco too long before selling it, relates a misunderstanding over a "hamper" of claret, and orders some burgundy and champagne.

</a> he Says he had them out of Gamell in the Bay, I Suppose these <br>goods must come from you I have not Seen the inside In <br> making  up your  Accots: of Sales you take a method that to me Seems <br>very  Erronious.  First you pay down the whole duty and then you <br>Sell the greatest part for Export giving Credit for the drawback <br>upon  wch

</font>
</S>  Please
</i> to anwer at time,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now allow me to turn my head a little on <br> Politics   We  are in a great design to get the Clause in the <a href=#n5>Act <br> <S><font color="red">in the
</font>
</S>   Prohibiting  the  Stemming 
</a>  Tobacco   repealed  Our Councll &amp; <br>Burgesses have  Addressed  his Majesty and made Application to the <br> Parliament . about it.  We  have  Employed  a  Gentleman  of our Country <br>one of our Eminentest Lawyers as our Agent who is going home <br>to  Solicit  this Affair,  We  have great reson to hope the London <br> Merchants  and Outports will  Join  their Interest with us and  we   <br>are told from many of your Countrymen here Your  represen<br>tatives will  Join  their helping hand, And that you are generally <br>hearty aweary of this restraint most Certain it is that by de=<br>nying us the liberty of  Stemming  our  Tobacco  all the Trash and under <br> Tobacco  is  Shipped   off.  It is become the Common trade  through  the Country <br>to buy up this under  Tobacco  as it is  called  but more properly Lugs <br>at half price and none is bad but the Planters can get Something <br>for it and when they lay out their Crops many will force the <br> Merchants  to take two or three under hogsheads or Else they will not let <br>them have their best These things your  Merchants  can give you <br>a better Account  of  than  I. Whereas if we are allowd to  Stem  <br>our under  Tobacco  we Should Seperate the good and heave the Trash <br>away and this  Stemmed   Tobacco  would be as  valuable  nay more <br> than  the best leaf which  we  know from long Experience. And  we <br>cannot think it would hurt the King in his Customs.  Stemmed  <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3

</center><br><br> Tobacco  must be  Comsumed  in the nation and pay the duty. but this <br>rubbish Stuff as it is now managed must be either  Clandestinely  <br>run or Else Sent abroad either way the King has no Custom, And <br>the Market prodigious  depressed   <S><font color="red">as well
</font>
</S>  to the damage of the  Fair  <br>trader as well as planter, And What Should hinder if the King <br>is no  loser  and if the Commodity would be much betterd to the <br> Merchants as  we  think is very demonstrable but that we may <br>reasonably promise our Selves Success inthis undertaking. <br>You make a Considerable figure in Glasgow where the greatest <br>part of the  Tobacco  in North  Britain   centers,  I thought it not <br>amiss to give you this Short  Entertainment   about  this affair <br>I could name you Several of your  Merchants  here that tells us <br>you will readily and  Strenuously  add your Endeavours to <br>take of this prohibition, I am

</S> This Accompanys <a href=#n4> Captain  Bowman 
</a><br>and brings you a bill of Lading for 29 hogsheads of  Tobacco  another is ready <br>for him but he cannot take it in, I have a pretty deal of  Tobacco  on <br>my hands yet to come home and prize where I Shall get it  freighted  <br>I dont yet know  beleive
</i> I Shall Choose rather  Glasgow      than   any
</i> other Port I <br>have often  Complained  to you of these  lag  Sales and upon very good <br>reason for they always prove the worst now you Say if I would <br>have Quick returns I must give orders to you to Sell at the Mast, this <br>will Entirely defeat me of any profit for my money. I am for tak=<br>ing that way that will return me the most but that I must leave <br>to your  Judgement  who  <S><font color="red">up
</font>
</S>   are
</i> upon the Spot and yet after all I must press <br>you to make up your Accots: as quick as you can that I may know <br>my doom Your have been very  large  in making up your  Accot: of the <br>James river  Tobacco  there is some more coming to you from thence <br>both of my own and <a href="Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr. Burwells
</a> Concern  it is  your mistake to call <br>it <a href="Cbiodir.html#ECB"> Madam  Burwells 
</a>the most of this is  Tobacco  which wee call <br>under  Tobacco  Therefore if you dispose of it at the Mast it may perhaps <br>be the best way Your Country men and the Outport Merchants <br>have bought up this  Tobacco  all over Virginia and have given 2d <br>a pound in their Stores for it I will hope this  Tobacco  will rise pretty <br>well and return us a tolerable price,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n7> Captain  Gamell
</a> Sent  ashore  my Pack of Goods <br>in another Ship was bound hither <a href=#n8>Dunlop Master
</a> and with it <br>a hamper of  Claret  I refused to take it telling him it did not <br>belong to me I know nothing of it he assured me Gamell told him <br>it was for me, upon which I was free with it proved good wine<br><br> <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>5

</center><br><br>and very Opportunely come for our  Governor  Soon after made me a <br> Visit  which cost me a good deal of it Since I have understood by <br>Mr. Gay the wine  belonged  to Colonel Epps of James river, I Suppose it was <br>of your  Shipping all that I can Say is you must Charged my Accot <br>with it and give Epps Credit or Send him the wine again as you <br>See fit,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Burgundy &amp;  Champagne  you Sent me from <br> Dublin  Some years ago hath kept so well that I think it is as <br>good now as when it first came I desire you will Send me 4  dozen  <br>of each Sort if you have Opportunity and from the Same person <br>you bought that by whose Extraordinary care in the well bottling <br>Corking and the well packing I reckon hath been  a
</i> great means <br>to keep it so well I would also have you Send me 6 or 8  dozen  of <br>right good  Claret  I Shall Conclude at present<br><br>herein is a bill of Lading for 12 hogshead belonging to <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Colonel Page

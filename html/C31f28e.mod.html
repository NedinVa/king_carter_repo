 Corotoman,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>28 June 1731<br><br>
To John Randolph Esqr<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to your Desire I now send you three Sets of <br>
bills of  Exchange,   <S><font color="red">[illegible] For</font></S>   on</i> my own Accot for &pound;56.7.6 on <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr Pemberton</a> <br>
of  Liverpool,  the other two sets for one hundred &amp; fifty three pounds <br>
&amp; Sixpence on Accot of <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Colonel  Page's</a> Estate on <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr Perry;</a> to these Sets the <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#">Secretary's</a> Hand must be had &amp; I absolutely depend upon your <br>
Word for it. Mine being an Outport Bill may perhaps not be <br>
so very agreeable. If it will be the least Detriment or Disappoint=<br>
ment to you, return thm by my Son &amp; I will send you London Bills <br>
in the Room of them. I had some Apprehensions these Bills upon <br>
 your  accot of Colonel Page were to be delayed  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S>   till the</i> going out of some of the <br>
 Later  Ships; how Mr Secretary will relish giving  them  so soon I can't say <br>
you know what a ticklish affair this is, but I can't think a little time <br>
will make any Difference with our Creditor,  although  in our Advices we <br>
told him our Bills would not come upon him till the  later  Ships<br>
	I believe in two or three months I may have Occasion for a --  <br>
 pretty  large Sum of Cash  it may be a hundred pounds or more;</i> how your Stock may hold out you will please to <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advise 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
advise me I shall look out to no other; I have several in my View that <br>
will willingly embrace my Custom, but I shall not look further <br>
if you will supply me. I am in no doubt you have taken proper Care <br>
in the Security of my Purchase. I heartily wish  you</i> the  Enjoyment  of your  Entire  <br>
Health &amp; am 
</p>

<br> Sir  <br>
Your most humble Servant
<br><br>I send a  Letter  of advice with <br>
my Bills on Pemberton If you <br>
return thm please to send that back to me also.

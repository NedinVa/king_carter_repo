Perry had written Carter in March that they should once again pursue the purchase of John Lloyd's Virginia estates (which Carter is managing), and Carter agrees but states that the value has fallen because of the great loss of slaves. Perry should first be aware that Carter is calling on his accounts with him for nearly &pound;500 to pay for slaves he has purchased, but Perry may offer &pound;3000 for the estate with the former conditions. If Perry is to pay the last year's rent for the Northern Neck proprietary, he should deduct Edmund Jenings's debt, and see that it is paid to Carter to whom it is due. Carter informs Perry that merchant Robert Cary will attempt to recover failed merchant Thomas Evans's debts to Carter. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Micajah Perry,</a> June 2, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>June 2st: 1727<br><br>Mr. Micajh: Perry<br> <br>Sir -- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be Copyd<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last went by <a href=#n1>Hopkins</a> and <a href=#n2>Woodward</a> <br>who it seems took their fate and would not Stay to  Join  the <br>next Fleet I then let you know the reasons that brought me to <br>a resolution of Sending you no  tobacco  neither of my own nor <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr. <br>Burwells</a> Concern  this year</i> it  lies  in your power to bring your Self <br>into a Share of mine and Mr. Burwell's business  again</i> if you think <br>fit to do no Justice in what  we  complain of</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now  Yours  of 8th and 15th. of March I find you <br>are Stirring again  <S><font color="red">in the</font></S>  towards the purchase of the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#LL">LLs</a> Estate <br>upon the Encouragement of  a</i> Letter of mine dated in  November  which <br>gave you an Accot: of the great losses I had  Suffered  in my Slaves <br>to recruit which I have lately bought near four Score Slaves <br>(and must Suddenly value my Self upon you for near five <br>hundred pounds  believing  our differences runs so high you will <br>not Concern your Self any further with the LLs Estate upon <br>my Accot:) and from this late Purchase you may Conclude <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>I am become  more</i> Indifferent who has the LLs Estate and Considering <br>the losses that hath fallen upon the Slaves I cannot think it now <br>worth above Three Thousand pounds, which if you think proper <br>to be further  Concerned  with my Correspondence taking my <br>former Instructions along with it you may give provided <br>you have two years time of Payment at least that is not <br>above one <a href=#n3>moiety</a> per year next fleet and another per the Fleet <br>after,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how you manage in the  Proprietors  Affair I <br>dont know but if you pay the last years rent I Expect  you'll  <br>deduct <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#EJ">Colonel  Jenig's </a> debt is Thirty nine pounds fourteen <br>Shillings which is Justly due from them to him and from him <br>to me as by a former Accot: you already know,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#TE"> Thomas  Evans</a> upon a Just ballance <br>owes me near four hundred pounds besides the 10 hhds. of  tobacco  <br>I Consignd him by <a href=#n4> Trevisa </a> which <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#RC">Mr. Cary</a> hath taken up <br>for me and promises me to be Accountable for this hath <br>bin a fatal year upon me for losses Additional to the  Several  <br>poor years that you know I have lately met with pray God <br>grant me a Christian resolution to bear with Submission <br>with  his</i> heavy hand and allow me life and health to retreive <br>these Severe losses I Shall Conclude this Melancholy  Story  <br>at present and am </p><br>Sir, Yor: most humble Servt:<br><br>herein I Send you two bills of  exchange  <br>drawn upon your Self. <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#RM"> Richard  Meeks</a> <br>for &pound;35 and <a href=#n5> Captain  Keelings</a> for &pound;33:7 <br>which are to be placed to my Credit<br>per Keeling -- <br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad.

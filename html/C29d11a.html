<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The letters of the abbreviation written down by Carter's clerk are fairly clear, but what the word that Carter dictated was is not at all clear. From the context, it would seem that Mr. L. might have been avoiding Carter, but there is no obvious word that Carter might have used that fits the abbreviation.</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1729 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission would be successful.   ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  [Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.] p. 116.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Major William Thornton (d. 1742/43) of King George County. (  <i>King George County Virginia Will Book A-1 1721-1752 And Miscellaneous Notes.</i>  [Fredericksburg, VA: Privately Printed, 1978], p. 277.</a>)</a>

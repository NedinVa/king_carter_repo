</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his son-in-law [Mann Page, May 21, 1728], to inform him that George Braxton's slave ship has arrived, and that he has written Braxton that he and Page may take as many as 30 of the slaves if Braxton will anchor the ship at Page's home, and give good credit and prices. He gives Page instructions to handle the purchases for him, specifies the working slaves that he wishes, and 3 young ones for his grandchildren.

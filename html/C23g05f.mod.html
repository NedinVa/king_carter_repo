They complain that Dawkins has not given the children's account the benefit of the customs discounts. They send a bill of lading for 7 hogsheads of tobacco, and report a bill of exchange to Carter for expenses and enclose an invoice (not present) for goods for the children and their slaves. They request Dawkins make available &pound;10 to Isaac Lee when he reaches England, should he need it. In a post script dated July 26th, Carter reports four bills of exchange drawn on Dawkins.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter and [<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1">Mann Page</a>] to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WD">William Dawkins,</a> July 5 and 26, 1723</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa: [hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>July 5th. 1723<br><br>Mr: Wm: Dawkins<br> <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your goods in the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#CS">Carter</a> came in good order, the Sales of the Childrens <br>Tobacco are not so high as we had hopes they would have come <br>to, the Discounts of the Customs you take  wholy   to  yourself   <br>we cannot See upon a nice Calculation  <S><font color="red">upon</font></S>   of</i> the State of <br>that Acct: but a part of them Discounts justly belong to <br>the Children, you have had always their business,  &amp;</i> you have <br> professed   a great  deal  of friendship for their Interest, it would <br>please us to See the fruits of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereweith you have a bill of loading for 7 hogsheads of the <br>Childrens  tobacco  , it's all  stemmed    &amp;

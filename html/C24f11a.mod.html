</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Liverpool merchant John Pemberton, June 11, 1724, to enclose a bill  of lading for 22 hogsheads of leaf tobacco on board the <i>Vine,
</i> and commenting on the diminishing trade in the colony from the non-London ships. He adds that Scots merchants have taken much tobacco, and that the current crop will be poor in part because of the limit on plants that each man is allowed. He reports a number of bills of exchange, and alerts Pemberton that he will soon send an invoice for goods. He closes with a complaint that the slave shoes the merchant has sent are too  small.

</i> last Year, The  Scotch  have carried off 10 or 12 thousand hhds. <br> [...]
</i> their Ships won't carry above 4 thousand hhds. We are stinted <br>to the Planting  [6]
</i> thousand Plants per head &amp; have a Very poor prospect at <br>this time of Even getting that planted, All these things one Would <br>think will help the Markett -- 
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now to advise You of the Bills of  exchange  I have drawn <br>on You to this day, To Witt for &pound;18"17"5 to  Colonel <a href=#n2> Samuel Boush

</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

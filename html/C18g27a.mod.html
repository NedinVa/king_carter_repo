In one of your's this year you <br>advise me topurchase you some Tobo <br>upon bills. In another you  control  <br>yourself upon the news you hadof the <br>high prices given here.

I am <br>very sorry there issuch a flaw in <br>the reputation of one of your  family. <br> I think   you shouldbe so much <br>concernedat it as to attempt everything <br>in your power to bring him into the <br>humour of doing me justice:and <br>pray interest yourself so much at <br>least in my behalf to get an accot <br>what is become of mygoods.

It is not surprising thatRC could not obtain the sales report and money he mentions in this letter; in 1717, John Burridge'sestate had been seized by the Crown for non-payment of duties  on wine. John Burridge represented Lyme inParliament from 1710-1728. [Sedgwick,  Parliament, I, 509].</a>   <br><br><br><i>This text revised November 17,2008.</i></a>     </BODY></HTML>

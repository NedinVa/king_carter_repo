"Rappahannock," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a><br><br>The word "Mr." was struck out in front of Perry's name in this letter's address but the software will not permit it to be shown as struck as is done in the body of the letter.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2]  Elizabeth Burwell (1718-?) was Carter's grandaughter by his daughter, Elizabeth, and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell.

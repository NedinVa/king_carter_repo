 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to William Dawkins &amp; Company, July 29, 1731</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants William Dawkins &amp; Company, July 29, 1731, concerning tobacco he has shipped on board the <i>Bailey</i> for himself, his son Robert, and the Burwell and Mann Page estates. He encloses an invoice (not present) for goods, mentions his claims against merchant John Falconar's estate and the affairs of the Frying Pan copper mine, his and Dawkins'  problems in being part-owner of trading ships, and Tom Dove's hard work in the colony this year as master of the <i>Bailey.</i> He adds that should Dawkins decide to build a new ship for Dove, he would be willing to own a portion of her, and alerts them to several bills of exchange. He presses the merchants to return to a former method in their accounts, and of his need for a new clerk to replace Richard Chapman.</p>

Mr. William Dawkins &amp; Company<br>
 
<br>Gentlemen,<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Invoice of goods I have already<br>
 written  for for the Use of my  families  I now send another small invoice <br>
which I would have Come in as Early as  you  can and by no means to Come in <br>
the same Ship with my other Invoice that I may  not</i>  risk  both in the same<br>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to " you ur ship Bailey.")</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See Carter to William Dawkins, and Carter to Falconar's executors, both 1730 April 16, for Falconar's death date.  Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953. p. 129</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful. (<a href="Cbibl.html#">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.</i>  pp. 18-19;</a> and <a href="Cbibl.html#">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .</i>  p. 342. </a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] the Rappahannock</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] "Thos. Edwards, a little petty Fogging Lawyer the Clark of our
County that hath as much Mettle and more cunning for Contention then his predecessor had" Carter wrote
to Landon Jones, July 22, 1723. His opinion of Edwards later changed for there are more appreciative mentions of him in Carter's diary. Edwards was clerk of the Lancaster County court from 1720-1746. (  <i>Within the Court House at Lancaster.</i>  Lively, VA: Lively Printing Services, Lively, VA: Lively Printing Services, [1976]. p. 15.</a>; and "Thomas Edwards, Gentleman, Clerk of the Court." <a href="Cbibl.html#">Brown.  <i>Virginia Baron. . . .</i>  pp. 94-103.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Carter may refer to Thomas Lee (1690-1750) of Westmoreland County who was the son of Richard Lee II, and nephew of Edmund Jenings; he would build "Stratford," and succeed Carter on the Council. For a good article on Thomas Lee, see  that <A HREF="http://www.stratfordhall.org/thomas.html?RESEARCH"> by Jeanne A. Calhoun </A>on Stratford plantation's website. ( Burton J. Hendrick.  <i>The Lees of Virginia: Biography of a Family.</i>  [Boston: Little Brown, 1935]. pp. 48, 51, etc.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] As Carter's clerk, Chapman had written and signed as a witeness to Carter' will and several of its codicils.</a>

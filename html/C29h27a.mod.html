 Corotomon,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>Augt. 27th. 1729<br><br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sending a messenger on purpose with Some letters to go by <br>
 [t] he <a href=#n2> [Will] iamsburg,</a> I [t]hought it proper to give you this line, I have not <br>
 [y] et determined whether to have you Stem all your  Tobacco  or no, at <br>
 [th] ose Quarters which  bears a high Character, the other  Quarters   [. . .]  va<br>
 [...] as Skedgye Creek &amp; <a href=#n3>Lyons Creek,</a> I beleve it will be prop [er] est <br>
 [ . . .]  small, laying the lop  leaf  Straight &amp; binding it into bundles <br>
the under  Tobacco  to be Carefully &amp; Neatly picked, and all  manner  of <br>
T [rash]  to be hove away, I am in Some doubt about the Lyon's Creek <br>
 [ . . .] , perhaps it will be best to make the top fair  unspotted   Tobacco  <br>
 [ . . .] es, for we have many times had as much for that Crop <br>
 [ . . .]  of them, The Same way I intend to have <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MH">Merchants hundred</a> <br>
 [ . . .]  all ordered, making none but the very prime of <br>
 [ . . .]  into bundles, Clean Steming all the rest  [ . . .] <br>
 [ . . .] ear it, to lay Straight &amp;  tie  up. I would have  you  Consult  [<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1">Colonel Page</a> about the ?]   management <br>  of <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#NB">Burwells Crops</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lying of my <a href=#n4>Rippon Mill</a> this long unto  [ . . . sticks] <br>
 [v] ery much in my  Gizzard  I am now with all my Streng [th working] <br>
 [o] n my dam that was  Carried  away, Rawson my Mill [er hath]  <br>
 [be] en imployed a Considerable time about repairing  [ . . .]  <br>
all of which wanted a great deal of work, And he is either gone <br>
or going to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#EAW">Mrs. Wormleys</a> to  <S><font color="red">Mend</font></S>  build</i> her Mill, &amp; is engaged to do <br>
it before he can touch mine I have alalong   [<i>sic</i>]</i> designed &amp; do Still <br>
to have the most of my Mill framed at home where I think <br>
 [I C] an get all my Sills &amp; timbers tht. are to  lie  Exp [ose] d to be  [out]  <br>
 [o] f Locust,  ugh  I am Still in hopes of getting  [ . . .]  <br>
that may be wanting of Sound  Cedar  Some where about  [ . . .]  <br>
 [ . . .]  now to bring Roson with  [ . . .]  <br>
 [ . . .]  Mill must Stand, &amp; how  [ . . .] <br>
 [...plea] sed god to  disappoint  me  [ . . .]  <br>
 [ . . .]  ever Considering how well hands  [ . . .]  <br>
 [ . . .]  out the Rippon Gang to go about  [ . . .] <br>
 [ . . .] ast half a  Dozen  of the  [ . . .] <br>
 [ . . .]  nt the work with all expeditio [n ...]  


<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
The Rest of the gang may very well get the Fodder  [ . . .]  <br>
and I think if 3 or 4 of the best of mill hands  [ . . .]  <br>
went to Assit them, for Six weeks or two months,  [ . . .]  <br>
there would be no great damage done to that plantation  [th] e <br>
 Difficulties  Seem to  lie  in your way, one how to get   [whe] el</i> barrow [s]  <br>
I am in hopes your dam is so near finished that we may <br>
get some from thence, or at least that there is Stuff enough <br>
at your house to make Some, &amp; that the Carpenters may be <br>
Spared to make as many as we Shall want, they may be made <br>
at home &amp; Sent over in a  Flat  &amp; this to be done with all Expedition</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Difficulty is to have a person always to be with these <br>
people to keep them to their Work, it will be very hard as well as not Conve<br>
-nient for Pasquet always to be there, &amp; it will be Necessary tht. he be with  <br>
his other people often, in Carrying on the plantation Work, to remedy <br>
this I propose that each of the other overseers Wright Madeson &amp; O [li] ver <br>
each take his day to be there one day in the Week, &amp; that they take <br>
turns one of them to be there two days, &amp; Pasquet to attend two days <br>
in every week, This I am Sure none of the overseers will Grumble at <br>
they li [ving]  within half an hours ride the furthest of them, you must <br>
provid [e t] hem some Meat by killing either at Rippon or Merchants <br>
hundred a  Middling   Hog,  or a Cow, Bull, or Steer, as  you  Shall thing   [<i>sic</i>]</i><br>
 proper,  Indeed I would all the people (it is hard work if they follow <br>
it Close) a pound of Meat a man,  one day if not two  days  in a week <br>
thus I have laid the method of Carrying on my Dam, &amp; it may be <br>
made a noble one between this and  December   big  &amp; high enough I <br>
recken to have nothing to do when the mill is built but Just to Stop <br>
the water, I carry on my Dam here in the Same  manner  My Overseers <br>
two &amp; two take their day round &amp; so fill up the week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember right the earth at both end of the dam is <br>
very good Clay; I must leave it to your  Judgment  from what place they <br>
S [hould]   Carry  the earth, if both Sides are alike the Quickest way will  [be to]  <br>
have half  only  from one Side &amp; half from the Other &amp; the  [ . . .]  <br>
into the Middle of the dam where it is now to be  Stopped   [ . . .]  <br>
to build the Mill on the first land on the lower or Nearer side  [ . . .]  <br>
and by  taking  away the land  therefore  the Dam 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br>
 [ . . .]  the larger which  will be of service in the other <br>
 [ . . .]  I intend to cut my <a href=#n5>Weast,</a> but all these things <br>
 [I mus] t leave to your Consideration as you are upon the Spot*<br>
 [ . . .]  I  [ho] pe you will drive on this work with all the vigour &amp; <br>
Industry you can, &amp; be as often there as you can be Spared <br>
without damage to your other business, In which you <br>
will very much oblige your friend
</p>

<br><br><br>P.S. <br>
*I intend my Dam Shall be large &amp;<br> 
high enough to pen water for a  breast <br> 
Mill  <br>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. The first page of this letter has suffered considerable damage including large sections missing along both margins. There is some damage to the second and third pages as well.</a>

<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br>The addresse's name, if present on the draft, has been lost due to damage to the sheet. The editor believes that internal evidence indicates that the letter was addressed to William Camp; see footnote #1.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&amp;pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11.   <i>Virginia Tax Records.</i>  [Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, Inc., 1983.] p. 539.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2y] The London ship  <i>Williamsburgh</i> was a large vessel of 550 tons and carried a crew of 26 men. Charles Rogers commanded her in 1727-29.  ( Adm 68/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] There is a Lyons Creek in York County and Carter probably refers to farms there that were under Camp's direction.</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. ( "Notes and Queries."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.</i>  2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary,</i> "weast" is an obsolete meaning of "west." Accordingly, what Carter meant by the use of this word is unclear.</a>

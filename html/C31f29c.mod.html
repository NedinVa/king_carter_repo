 Corotomon, <i>[sic]</i>   [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>29 June 1731<br><br>
Capt. Geo. Turbervile<br>
 
<br>Sir,<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to yours of yesterday I begin with the <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#JC1">Secretary's</a> Business. <a href=#n1>Mr. Lord</a> of the 9th  Instant</i> tells me he had  received  of the Secret [ar] ys <br>
 Tobacco  in their Parish Six  hogsheads  which you had told him he must accot <br>
to you for. I have given Will Rowing, who is now in my Sloop  --  <br>
particular orders to take in this  Tobacco  if he can get it, however it will <br>
not be amiss if you spur on Lord to be  careful  in getting the  Tobacco  on board <br>
the Sloop. Mr. Lord mistakes himself when he  says  he hath no List of the <br>
Secretary's  Fees,</i> I'm sure he or some of his Officers had the list from me. <br>
I sent away the List I had from the Secretary's Office soon after it came <br>
to my hands. It amounted to 3694 pounds ot  Tobacco .</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary between his Clerk &amp; the Sheriff meets with  --  <br>
very extraordinary usage, what his fees came to in 1729 you are no  --  <br>
Stranger to. Four  hogsheads  of his Tobacco that were to be weighty &amp; to come<br>
from Minors, were not  rolled  when my Sloop called for them not <br>
 until  I went up a little before Christmass, &amp; they were very light at last <br>
how much of the Accot is paid I know not. If this Sloop misses of his  Tobacco  <br>
I believe Mr Lord may expect a Call from the Secretary. This Rate of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
Management will hardly find him Paper &amp; Pens &amp; Ink for his <br>
office; he is to be here is   [<i>sic</i>]</i> eight or ten dayes he will then consider <br>
what is proper for him to do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to my own Business. Your Bill of  exchange  <br>
for eight pounds five shillings &amp; Eleven pence discharges the  Balance  <br>
of your Money Debt. Your  balance  in  Tobacco  Is 3901. <a href=#n2>Sallard</a> <br>
accots to me for three thousand one hundred &amp; thirty eight, You <br>
 Balance  the Rest by a long Bed Roll of Fees, many of them I  --  <br>
understand not You charge me with Orders for Fines I don't re= <br>
member I ever had two pence for all the Fines; some of them I am <br>
sure are not mine to pay. The Charge of Mrs. Newton's Power of <br>
Attorney for Reliquishment of her Dower  <S><font color="red">is none of mine</font></S>   lies not properly against me</i><br>
 <S><font color="red">to pay</font></S> ; I never authorized such a thing nor will I take any  --  <br>
thing less than her Personal appearance at Court &amp; Private  --  <br>
Examination as you already know; fees for this I suppose I <br>
shall hear of hereafter; I pray you therefore to put the Saddle<br>
upon the Right Horse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mention something of a pair of Milstones I had  -- <br>
from your Father. I remember I had a pair of stones from <a href=#n3>Turkey <br>
Cock hill</a> which was many Years before <a href=#n4>your Father</a> died &amp; several<br>
years  after</i> I delivered them with his Consent, as far as I can collect<br>
the story, to  Captain  <a href=#n5>Richard Ball,</a> who claimed them as his. I  --  <br>
know Nothing more of them, If I had them you should be  -- <br>
welcome to them; which is the  Needful  at present from

</p>

<br>your humble Servant

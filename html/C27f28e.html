He tells Pemberton to charge his account with &pound;62 due Pemberton, and also for "Gales bill protested." He also sends two bills of exchange , an invoice for goods  which he wishes to have shipped by an early ship, and a bill of lading  for 30 hogsheads shipped on the <i>Rappahannock.</i> He concludes by reporting that his negotiation for some of "Esqr. Hallows" land is at a standstill over the price. In a lengthy post script dated July 26th, Carter adds information about other bills of exchange, the safe arrival of Pemberton's slave ship, the <i>John and Betty,</i> and Carter's handling of the sale of the slaves. In a second lengthy post script dated August 23 Carter encloses a bill of lading for tobacco  and orders that it be "sold at the Mast." He also encloses an account of the sales of slaves and 30 first bills of exchange received during the sale, noting that he is sending second bills of exchange by the <i>Carter.</i> He and Captain Denton have had a dispute over Carter's role in the sale and the commission charged for his services; he writes that he had undertaken the sale as a favor to Pemberton, an old friend, and that he will deal only with the principal in such matters, not with the ship's master. None of the enclosures mentioned are present.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JP">John Pemberton,</a> June 28, July 26, and August 23,1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>June the. 28th: 1727<br><br>Mr. John Pemberton<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This by <a href=#n1>Watkinson</a> brings you a bill of <br>Lading but for 17 hhds: of the <a href=#n2> John and Bettys </a> Tobbo: he Sent his <br>Boat for 5 hhds: more but when the men went for them an Accid<br>ent had  happend  by the house they were in falling down they had <br> Sufferd  Some damage so they brought them to my house and left <br>them behind Immediately they were uncased and all the damaged <br>Tobbo: taken out which amounts to no more then 90 pounds weight there <br>remains now of that Concern to Ship 17 hhds: besides some debts <br>outstanding  Wee  hear nothing of Capt: Denton yet if he Should <br>come it will be impossible for him to get his Load what to do with <br>this Tobbo: I dont know how to Ship it to any other port  then  yor. own <br>I have no orders I hear Capt: Preston in the  Mary  of your Port takes <br> freit  if I can get him to take it in I think to do it but if I can <br>meet with no Opportunity to Ship it I Shall think it a Service <br>to you to get it home in Some of my own Craft for its preservation</p><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Th]</i></font></sup>e outstanding Sterling debts amounting to Sixty two pounds I <br> <S><font color="red">have got <sup><font color="green">not yet gold</i></font></sup></font></S>  in <sup><font color="green">to pay which</i></font></sup> <S><font color="red">you must pay your Self and  Dentons Accot. with <br>that Sum</font></S>  I have not yet got all in however I am desirous you Should <br>be paid therefore <sup><font color="green">please to</i></font></sup>  devite  my Accot:  <S><font color="red">for</font></S>  that Sum also you must   -- <br>charge my Accot: with Gales bill protested &pound;15:18-which is money <br>I Shall be out of a year if not two or three -- </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Herein are two Small bills of Exchange drawn upon <br>your Self which I desire Credit for Thos: Beale for &pound;5:10::17 Robert <br>Gordon for &pound;4"10"8 3/4 -- Also an Invoice for Some goods which I <br>desire my be Sent in In one of you forwardest Ships, the goods coming <br>so late this year was an inconveniency to me You have likewise <br>now a bill of Lading for 30 hhds: of my own Crop Tobbo: in the <a href=#n4> Rappahannock </a> <br>I take all the Care I can to make it good hope it will prove so and meet <br>with a Comfortable Sale I have not news yet of the Arrival of Capt.

Some of that land was purchased in 1733 by Thomas Lee from Samuel Hallowes of County Lancaster, England, who "as a great nephew of Major John Hallowes," had acquired title in an important legal case decided in 1722. This land became part of Stratford. Carter may have hoped to acquire a tract from Samuel Hallowes to add to Nomini as John Hallowes had lived near that plantation of Carter's.

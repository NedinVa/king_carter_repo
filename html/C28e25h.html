The bulk of the letter is devoted to persuading Tucker, a member of the House of Commons, to support the colony's desire to repeal the act of Parliament probhibiting the importation of stemmed tobacco into England. In a post script dated July 8th, Carter notes that he plans to send 30 hogsheads of tobacco in Captain Willson's ship, reports bills of exchange, and orders beer, malt, and ale. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#ET">Edward Tucker,</a> May 25 and July 9, 1728</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>May the 25th: 1728<br><br>Edward Tucker Esqr.<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round about Voyage by the way of <br>  Antego   <a href=#n1>Capt: Willson</a> came Safe in at last, I had Some damage <br>in my Beer Necessity forced him in his long passage to refresh <br>his men and himself with Some of it; but that he and I shall <br>Accommodate,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein Send you a bill of Exchange of <a href=#n1><a href=#n2>Thos: Edwards </a></a><br>for &pound;13:12:3:d Also John Kirks for &pound;8"9:11 both on your Self <br>which desire Credit for,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n3>Capt: Brett</a> soon after his coming in Spoke to me <br>for Some freight, Accordingly I promised him, but the number of <br>hhds: I could not then tell, I was a long time kept from home at <br>our Assembly and General Court, he sent two Sloops into our <br>parts, the last was after I got home and might have taken in <br>Some of my Tobbo: but he had Some better  freinds  to pleasure <br>I Suppose and so left me totally out Capt: Willson I intend to <br>ship upon if he  doth  not Serve me as Brett  hath  done he  hath  <br>Sent me word he will be with me in a few days when we Shall <br>Adjust that matter,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the general Opinion of the Gent in the Country <br>that the great Occasion of sending of so much Trash and under <br>Tobbo: is by the restraint  wee  are under from  Steming  for now all <br>the ground leaves and under Tobbo: are  tyed  up and go to market <br>none is so bad but the Outports Merchts. and the North  Brittains  <br>will buy at Some Price or other which  wee  reckon Computing <br>through the Country amounts to Several thousand hogsheads and does <br>very much depress the market for the better Sort of Tobbo: Whereas <br>if the good were  pickt  out by  Steming  it would be as  Valueable  <br>as the best Tobbo:  wee  make.

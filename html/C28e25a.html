His location, the county and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of 1727 May 17, Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,</i> but little information about Bradley has been located.</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] The 140 ton <i>Welcome</i> was owned by London merchant James Bradley to whom Carter would write about her on 1727 May 17.  John Trice (Frice) was her captain, 1723-1728.

This is the recipient's copy and  isentirely in the hand of and is signed by RC as is noted by the useof italics. William Dare was clerkof Lancaster County at this time. The single sheet has lost a portionwhich has removed much of the address on the reverse but it probablyread: "[William Da]re | [Lan]castr" since the last letters remain. Cloth tape obscures portions of the contemporary docket. What can beread shows:  "July 28th 1718 | [del]ivered to T C." A docket in alater hand reads, "Man Page | to | Judith Carter" and scrawled belowthis in another hand is "1718."

</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That in Shipping the Tobaccoes  what I am Concern'd in, I shallChiefly <br>Consider the Interest of the Children, wch. will be to send most to them who <br>makes thebest Returns and when there is Money before hand, to Lodge <br>it in the Ablest hands where thereis least appearance of failure, wch. is <br>the Method I observe to my self in my Own affairs, I have noFriends or <br>Relations there further then they Rendr.  themselves bytheir good Managmt.  in myfavour.
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Books of Accots. Papers &amp;c. Remain where they wereto be <br>Viewed by the Trustees when they Please, but the Debts are  soe  Incon<br>-siderable, Except the Sheriffs &amp; Clerks Accots. they are hardly Worth the <br>Solemn Way of Settlingpropos'd
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be at all Times most Ready to give an Accot. to myCompanions as <br>far as I am Concern'd in Management when they Desire it, but for <br>a <siccorr="Dictatorship ">Dictatorshipp [sic]  amongst Us I am unwilling to yeild  to; will Rather <br>Cease to Meddle wth.any Dead Mans Estate while I Live
</p>   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is an Accot. of my Proceedings hitherto.
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Short Time after the Death of Esqr. Wormeley,  Wee   took probate upon his<br>will, Collo  Jenings not there, and that  Wee   might beEnabled for the Divi<br>-sion Mov'd the Court that an appraisement might be made by Judicious <br>Gentlemen and ObtainedOrder Accordingly.  Severall  Meetings  Wee   <br>had Month after Month,where I Constantly attended for the Division, but <br>for want of a Suitable Nombrs. of Appraisers, The Matter was notEffected <br>till December, Collo  Jennings at none of those Times, meeting, In the <br>-mean time, Ihave not bin  wanting in taking Care of the business of the Plan<br>-tations, a very Good <siccorr="Crop ">Cropp [sic]  was made, is <siccorr="prized">Preizd [sic] , and Freight I have <br>taken for the most part if not all, GoodOverseers Settled for the Ensuing <br>year, and the plantations in very good Order.
</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Cropp  made by Esqr.  Wormeley I  shipt  asfollowth.
</p>   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenn  hhds went to Mr. Corbin , wich I Leftmy Own  Tobaccoe   out for <br>and Lay byme all the year, He Writes me  Generall  he had soldfor <br>Nine pence 1/2 But no Accot. as  yett.  Sixteen hogsheads went to <a href="Cbiodir.html#FL">Mr. Lee
</a> <br>of the same Tobo.sold at Nine pence 3/4,  Tenn  pence, and <siccorr="Ten ">Tenn [sic]  pence 1/4 <br>he  hath  sent an Accot. of Sales butno accot. Currtt.Twenty seven hogsheads <br>went to <a href="Cbiodir.html#JM">Mathews

</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goods for the familys use Lost as above were sent for toMathews &amp;c. <br>Amounting as per Invoice to &pound;86:2:2.

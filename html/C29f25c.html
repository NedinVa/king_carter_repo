 Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br>
<br>June the 25th. 1729<br><br>
To the Right honble. the Ld. Fairfax<br>
 
<br>My Lord -- <br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Considering the orders of Council lately made  <S><font color="red">on</font></S> <sup><font color="green">upon</i></font></sup><br>
my puting in Caveats in your Lordships behalf I cant but observe that there <br>
appears to me to be a wide diference between former Govrs. Granting away the <br>
Lands in the <a href=#n1>little Fork</a> when there was no Caveat put in against them &amp; those <br>
back woods was then very little known and the <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Present Govrs.</a>  Continueing  these Grants <br>
after a Caveat is  Enterd  and Such Plain Proof offer'd that these Lands are within <br>
your Lordships bounds. Perhaps my reasoning may have no force in it. I have had<br>
Some private hints <sup><font color="green">from my Lawyers that they thought</i></font></sup> the Govr. was not very forward in going into this order <br>
but the Opinion of the Major part of the Council  prevaild  however it was your <br>
Lordship may Conclude it to be highly necessary for your Lordship to make as <br>
many friends as Possibly you can in England for I doubt the Grant will meet <br>
with but few friends here unless Some folks are made to know that the Estate <br>
is above their reach. In the other order you will meet with a great many new <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invented

names Such as Happy Creek. Cape Leanock. and the fork of Leanock ri [ver] <br>
and the fork of Cape Leanock Run and all  layd  down to lye in  Spotsilvan  [ia] <br>
County Contrived under these names never heard of before but in reality <br>
According to all  Informations  I can get they are only streams Issuing <br>
out of  Chenandoa  and discharge themselves  thro  it and if  Spotsilvania  <br>
County be to be Extended to all the Lands on the upper side of  Chenandoa  the <br>
great stream of  Patowmack  which I have often  Calld  Cohunkoruta <br>
the Indian name will be its Boundary and will surround to the Westward <br>
all your Lordships Grant I have Said Enough to give your Lordship a Right <br>
Idea of the nature of the place And it may be more then was necessary</p>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a 19th-century transcript of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The Fry-Jefferson map shows the Little Fork as a tributary of the Hedgman (now the Rappahannock) River. It lies in what is probably Culpeper County today, not far from the Blue Ridge. </a>

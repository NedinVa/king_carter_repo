These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparentlythere was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- nowlost -- from which the unknown copiest recorded these texts.

Gooch" to the heading of a letter obviously entered in the original letter book asaddressed only to the governor, then Spotswood, not Gooch.</a>  <br><br><a name="n2">[2] The trustees of the College of William and Maryelected a Rector from among their own number. RC first became avisitor (trustee) of the College about 1716, and held the post of Rector formany years. As the College records for this period are not extant, itis impossible to determine Carter's periods of service asRector.</a> <br><br><br><i>This text revised October 10, 2008.</i></a>      </BODY></HTML>

How He might alter his <br>Design afterwards, We can't say, but We find the Purchase was com <br> pleated  without any  Draughts  on You. By this Means great dis <br>putes have arisen <u>between Our Father and the Alderman</u> upon <br>Account of the Discounts not being allowed <u>on his Tobaccos</u>, and <u>He</u> <sup><font color="green">the Alderman</i></font></sup> <br>has before now seen how unkindly it was  <S><font color="red">its</font></S>  taken  <S><font color="red">that</font></S>  by our Father <br>that He could not have the usual Advantages after <sup><font color="green">so large a sum of </i></font></sup>his Money <br>had  layn  idle three or four Years, subject indeed to a payment in <br>the Court in Chancery, but without any Benefit in the mean time. <br>In Some of His Letters He tells the Alderman, He hoped to make him <br>such Remittances as would retreive his Credit in his Books and in <br>some measure make up the Prodigious Breach, which this large <br>Purchase had made. How this could have been effected, We cannot <br>at present  <S><font color="red">tell</font></S>  pretend to guess, unless by Bills drawn on You or <br>Mr. <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JP">John Pemberton</a> of  Liverpool . But we find such a large <br>Quantity of Tobacco <sup><font color="green">now</i></font></sup> sent to this Gentleman, a very great part of <br>which is Stemmed and consequently for home Consumption, that <br>We can't imagine He could design to draw anything considerable <br>on  <S><font color="red">this Gent</font></S>  him, when there would not sdufficient remain to clear <br>the Duties. The Conclusion must then be that He intended to have or-<br>der'd some of the Money in Your Possession to be paid to the Alderman <br>who will not otherwise have Money of Our Father's Estate to clear all <br>the Duties of Tobacco's consigned to him this present Year <sup><font color="green">for we do not think proper to touch the Bank Stock</i></font></sup> not to <br>mention any thing of a large Sum He is to pay to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#TF">Lord Fairfax.</a><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>Every Person has a Right to use his Own in the Manner He <br>thinks most for his Advantage, but we have been thus part-<br>tcular, that We might take off all Imputation of Unkindness <br>or Jealousie, which with truth We assure You is very far from <br>Our thoughts.  <S><font color="red">The</font></S>  We have now sent an Order on you to pay to <br>pay  [<i>sic</i>]</i></font></sup> to Micajah Perry Esqr. and Company the Sum of One <br>Thousand Pounds Sterling, which We verily believe Our Father <br>would have done, if He had lived  'till  this time, and We per <br>suade Ourselves You will not blame Us in Your own Thoughts <br>for desiring to make the Most of Our Tobacco. </p><br>We are, Sir, <br>Your Most humble Servants <hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a><br><br>The county and colony have been added to the heading for clarity.</a> </BODY></HTML>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Isaac Lee (1700-1727) was a son of Hancock Lee and his second wife, Sarah Allerton. Isaac was a resident of Westmoreland County but died in England.  (Descendants of John Lee , http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~kenzie/GenLEE.htm, 5/11/04)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Hancock Lee (1653-1709) was an intimate friend of Robert Carter who was named in Lee's will as "a good friend," and appointed one of the trustees of his children.  (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B11">Lee.  <i>Lee Chronicle . . .</i>  pp. 33-35.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</a>

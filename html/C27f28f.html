</font>
</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, June 28, 1727, to order some goods for the late Nathaniel Burwell's family and to enclose several bills of exchange (not present). He comments that many merchant ships have sailed from the colony without waiting for the convoys, and the colony's government has accordingly established an embargo to force the ships into convoys. He mentions the needs of the Lloyd estate and that he had hoped to be able to send an invoice for goods but circumstances have prevented him. In a lengthy post script dated July 26, 1727, Carter repeats his notice of bills of exchange of which he had notified Perry in an earlier letter, and sends (not present) a statement of Edmund Jenings's account with the Proprietors of the Northern Neck which shows a balance due Carter which he hopes will be credited against his next rent payment. He also reports Jenings's death on July 5, 1727. In a second post script dated August 22, 1727, Carter reports a bill of exchange for his daughter, Elizabeth Burwell Nicholas, and sends a bill of lading (not present) for tobacco belonging to the Lloyd estates. He notifies Perry that his grandson, Lewis Burwell, has been given permission to remain at school one more year before going to university, and that he has drawn bills on Perry payable to John Falconar and John Pemberton.

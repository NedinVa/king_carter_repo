There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] This vessel was commanded by Captain Constantine Cant and may have been owned by William Dawkins and Micajah Perry as Carter reported her December 1723 arrival to each of them. ( Adm. 68/194-195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter may refer to an excise tax which the colonists favored because of a variety of problems with the taxes on their tobacco, and particularly because of the act of parliament to which Carter refers earlier in his letter. Collecting debts owed by colonists to merchants in Great Britain was difficult for the merchants because of restrictive laws about proof of debts in Britain, and because there were two sets of books 3,000 miles apart, that carried the details of each transaction. In 1732 British merchants got through the act of parliament that made it much easier for them to collect these debts "merely on their own oaths" and which allowed them "to attach both real estate and slaves to secure them."

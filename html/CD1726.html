<br><br><a name="n23">[23] John Falconar was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell would form an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The associaton lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price.

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b>  Fairfax Proprietary papers, 1675-1843, BR 227, Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California. Listed: <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B12">Wright.  <i>Letters of Robert Carter. . . .</i>  p. 129.</a></a><br>

<br><br>On the back of the sheet is the address:  To | The Right Honor:ble Lady | Dowager Margaret Culpeper | at Leeds Castle | neer Maidstone  [Kent]</i> | Per Ashford | Bagg. It is written in a much neater hand (probably that of one of Perry's clerks) than the body of the letter.</a><br>

<br><br>This letter was written on paper that has allowed the ink to spread and blur a good many letters. In addition, there are holes in the sheet and considerable loss along its upper right margin causing loss of the final words of many lines. The text and signature appear to be in the same hand, that of Micajah Perry.(1641-1721).</a><br>

<br><br>Because this letter is addressed to "Dowager Margaret Culpeper," it cannot have been written later than May 1710 when she died. The month of the heading is all that remains of the original dating due to damage to the sheet; the editor has arbitrarily assigned the date of April [30, 1710] to the letter.  Because Louis B. Wright did not have the benefit of recent research, he dated the letter April 11, 1724.</a><br>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Margaret Culpeper (d. May1710) was the widow of the second Lord Culprper (d. 1689), and had inherited ownership of five sixth of the Northern Neck proprietary.  She had consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Proprietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. Carter held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. (See <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B8">Brown.  <i>Virginia Baron. . . .</i> </a>;   Warren Culpeper. <a href="http://www.gen.culpepper.com/historical/legends/lords.htm">"Four Lords: Not Enough Sons."</a> http://gen.culpepper.com/historical/legends/lords.htm;</a> and  Fairfax Harrison.  <i>The Proprietors of the Northern Neck: Chapters of Culpeper Genealogy.</i>  [1926],</a> for discussions of the Fairfax and Culpeper genealogy.)</a><br>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</a> <br>

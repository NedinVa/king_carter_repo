 Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>June the 27th. 1729<br><br>
Edward Tucker, Esqr.<br>
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ship coming directly from you this Year obliges me to<br>
write to you Via London.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your  last Letters bears date the 14th. of  October  and the 9th. of  December <br>
it is a miserable  story  you tell of  Tobacco 
 that it is so bad you had no Encourage<br>
ment to Continue in it.  We  must live in hopes of its mending. <a href=#n1> Captain  Wilson</a> is an<br>
unfortunate man. I am always a Considerable  Sufferer  by his ship, but I <br>
hope not so bad as you are in doubt of. The Malt and the Beer you sent by the<br>
 Harrison  I  received  but I cannot Say Safe, The hampers were so abused that wt.<br>
with Theivery and what with Breakage I lost one third of it. This I  suffer <br>
every way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By <a href=#n2>my loss by fire</a> of which no doubt you will hear I was<br>
 rendered  very poor in Liquor. the Cheese and the  sloops</i> Sails  I Expect you will send me<br>
in Early the next fall And I desire you to send me in also four hogsheads  of the best<br>
Dorset Ale well and Carefully  packed  up into Bottles  that I may be able to pay my Debts</i> I hope I shall have<br>
better luck with it then the last, There  has  been no Opportunity of sending<br>
 Tobacco 
 to your Port Else I should have found Some for you  Although  if your<br>
Markets remain as bad as you Say they were there will be little  difference <br>
between burning and  shipping  of it these are  dreadful   Considerations <br>
to us that have no other trade to maintain our  families  by, I must desire<br>
you to send me also a hogshead of your best Malt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herein I send you Colonel Hacks Exchange on  your self for &pound;3" -- <br>
which you will please to Credit my Account  with or Protest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  have had a  dismal   Judgement  upon our fruit trees these<br>
two Years together by  Caterpillers  however the last year  we  made a great deel of<br>
 Cider  that was Extraordinary good and if I had not loss   [<i>sic</i>]</i>  <S><font color="red">in</font></S>  my bottles in the  <S><font color="red">Cellar</font></S> 	<br>
fire I could have  Stocked  myself Plentifully for 2  Years  but now it is all  Pricked  &amp;<br>
 Spoiled  and  we  have the least fruit upon the Trees that ever I saw so that I must<br>
desire you if You can meet with any that is right good to send me a hogshead<br>
of <a href=#n3>Southam</a> well and Carefully bottled  off,  and Safely  packed   I am

</p>

<br>Sir<br>
 Your  most humble Servant-
<br><br>per <a href=#n4> Bailey </a><br>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] A Captain Wilson is mentioned in Carter's letter to Edward Tucker of 1721 May 27 as having arrived after "15 weeks passage." and in his 1723 diary.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter had built a fine house at Corotoman in the mid-1720s, but it burned in January 1729.  See the <i>Maryland Gazette</i> for 1728/29 February 4-11 for information about Carter's loss. </a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Southam is a type of English ale.</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</a>

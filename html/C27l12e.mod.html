He comments on Perry's charges for "Collo: Bolling's commission," for "Mr. Blew the lawyer," and on affairs of the estates of Nathaniel Burwell, Merchants Hundred, and the Lloyds. He concludes that he is pondering what to do with the &pound;1500 bank annuity which he assumes has come to Perry's hands because of the Act of Parliament. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Micajah Perry,</a> December 12, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa [hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>Decembr: 12th: 1727<br><br>Mr: Micajah Perry<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the favour of your two letters of the 23d of  August  <br>&amp; 9th of  October  &amp; find I am not to have the Discounts upon my 90 hogsheads allowed <br>me without the satisfaction of meeting with a Convincing reason why <br>you deprive me of it.

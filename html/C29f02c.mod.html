<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his attorney and friend, [John] Holloway, June 2, 1729, concerning the granting of lands on the Little Fork in areas that he believes belong to the proprietary. He speculates on the reasons behind the opposition to the proprietor's grant being made by the receiver general, John Grymes, and the grants being taken there by Henry Willis.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I wrote to you <a href=#n1>Mr. Owsley
</a> of Stafford  has  <br>been at my house a  noted   traveler  in the backwoods for many years <br>he tells me of a march he made when he was  a

</a> in  Company  with  Augustine  Smith the  Surveyor  &amp; Others <br>it is so  <S><font color="red">. . . ated

</S>   great
</i> An illustration of the forks of  our  River that that I <br>have thought it Proper to take it Under his hand and herein do <br>transmit to you he Adds further that not Above a fortnight or three <br>weeks ago he was at the <a href=#n3>new Germans
</a> as they are called who are sea-<br>ted upon the upper branches of Germana River and then he passed <br>Over all the Northern branches and is very well Assured  tht none
</i> that  has  <br> traveled   those  places will pretend to say there is any Comparison <br>between the Southern branch of the <a href=#n4>little Fork
</a> and the Northern <br>branches Which all to his certain knowledge head in a little way <br> <S><font color="red">. . .. befor

</a> his son  has  seat [ed]  <br>some  quarters  I have heard Upon an Alarm that will Beverley had from <br>the <a href="Cbiodir.html#JG2"> Receiver General 
</a>  has  lately made A Survey of this  Artful   Patent  <br>of his fathers And finds there is above Nine thousand Acres in it <br>this I have been told but Cannot Affirm the truth of it  Major  <a href=#n8>Henry <br>Willis 
</a> has  gone further into this Fork and taken up large quan<br>tities of Land Upon which I  believe  all the slaves he  has  in those <br>Parts are seated so that there is no great wonder to be made there is <br>such a mighty Struggle for this little Fork And my Grants th [at]  <br>I have made there I  believe  are Elder than  Major  Willis's  Colonel  Spots<br>wood no doubt was Altogether Surprised in to his grant and I mus [t]  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think that

All the Other  patents  that have Passed there since  has  been a <br>Surprise to <a href="Cbiodir.html#HD"> Colonel  Drysdale
</a> for I cannot think Any  Governor  that is clearly <br>Apprehend <S><font color="red">sive

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost think it will be but A Proper respect to the  Governor  <br>and what will be no way as Offensive upon a proper Opportunity  if  you  would

</font>
</S>  <br>make him Acquainted with the description of these places from <br>the full testimony we have but this I must Submit to your Considera=<br>tion
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sometimes wonderd at the great heat of  our   Receiver  <br> General  against the  Propietors  grant and especially in this business of the <br>little fork at first I imagined a huge desire he might have to get <br>the Northern neck Added to the Crown (a very pretty Perquisite to a <br> Receiver  General ) that  Occasioned  his Zeal to Appear so hot but I am now <br> thoughtfull of another great Spur he may be Under which I shall <br>communicate to you in Confidence
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years Ago  Major  Willis was in such perplexity <br>About Answering the Calls of his <a href=#n9>Son in Laws
</a> Estate that he <br>was put Under the necessity of borrowing money I lent him &pound;200 <br>and I fancy he had more of Others by the Assistance of  Colonel  Grymes <br> <S><font color="red">[illegible]
</font>
</S>  I take it that my money was paid me and I have a notion that <br>this land and his Slaves are Under Mortgage to him for his security <br> Colonel  Grymes is the Guardian of this boy by All his relations desire <br>now if this estate of Willis's be mortgaged whether it be for the <br>security of  Colonel  Grymes or the scarcity of the boys Estate I cannot <br>take him to stand as an indifferent Person or that his Zeal arises <br>Merely from the Duty of his place it is very likely you may <br>be more familiarly Acquainted with the terms that  Major  Willis &amp; <br> Colonel  Grymes are upon I am not At All desirous  <S><font color="red">from

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

He adds comments about the Lloyd estate, and William Dawkins' ship, the <i>Carter</i> (in which he owns an interest), and in closing reminds Perry that he has never received any payment for his administration of the Lloyd estate since the time of the merchant's grandfather. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Micajah Perry,</a> December 12, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [ Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>Decembr: 12th: 1727<br><br>Mr: Micajah Perry<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yours of the 9th of  October  you are pleased <br>to Advise me that After a great number of Attendance on the <a href=#n1>Lords of <br>trade</a>  you  have at last got the Attorney's &amp; Solicitor Generals opinion <br>upon the Northern Neck Affair differing in some points from their <br>former Opinions, which <a href="Cbiodir.html#JC">Mr Clayton</a> tells  you  proceeded from the different <br>Stating of the question; &amp; that the Lords have sent in their Opinions to-<br>gether with their instructions to the <a href="Cbiodir.html#WG"> Governor </a> I shall only Observe that <br>Mr Clayton hath all along been a strenuous enemy in this Affair <br>&amp; I am apt to think hath strongly pursued it in prevailing upon the <br>Lawyers to Alter their Opinions as for the state of the Case I am sure <br>they had it rightly before, The Grant &amp; all the words of it relating to <br>the  Controversy  were nakedly laid before them But if the  Proprietors <br>will sit still &amp; suffer their rights to be determined from them with<br>out ever  strugglig  in defence of them they must not lay the fault on <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>me, what Determination the Lords are come to in this  <S><font color="red">Affair</font></S>   [...]</i> <br>is not yet come to my knowledge  although  I Expect it soon will it seems <br>a little strange that my <a href="Cbiodir.html#TF"> Lord  Fairfax</a> who is the heir at law should not <br>at least have had the strength of some other lawyers in defence of <br>his Cause</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your next Paragraph relates to the <a href="Cbiodir.html#LL">LL's</a> <br>affair Advising me of the little  likelihood  there is of bringing it <br>to an End &amp; desiring that this Crop may be  shipped  in <a href=#n2>Keeling</a> &amp; tells me <br>he   informed </i>  you  I had kept back the  Tobacco   until  he was near loaded this Story <br>I have taxed Keeling with wch: he disowns if he did say it he wronged me <br>egregiously for instead of delaying him I sent the  tobacco aboard in a <br>Sloop of my own &amp; instead of twelve hogsheads of that  Tobacco  that I put <br>into the <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter </a> I put twenty of my own into him beleiving it to <br>be safer for the Estate to ship it  in</i> two bottoms than one</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Cbiodir.html#WD">Mr Dawkins</a> acquaints me he  <S><font color="red">is</font></S>   intends to</i>  send <S><font color="red">ing</font></S>  <br>the Carter to us  <S><font color="red">again</font></S>  with all dispatch if he makes her a lag <br>Ship it may be  doubtful  she will still continue  to be</i> an unfortunate one, <br>for my own part I have little reason to Desire a continuance of <br>my interest in her it would have been a great Deal of money saved <br>in my pocket had she been sold seven Years  ago </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	According to a former desire of yours I now send <br>you a Copy of your Mortgage &amp; an Accot of the  mortalities   <S><font color="red">at  that estate</font></S>   for the slaves</i> <br>since the last Accot you had, you give me no  intelligence yet of any Goods co=<br>ming for the supply of  those   families   you  will not Expect them to be sub=<br>sisted without  Clothes  &amp; tools.

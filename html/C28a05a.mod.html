Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] Robert Alexander (d. 1735) was a resident of Prince William County who would become a justice in 1734. Carter used the title of "major" which probably meant that Alexander was a militia officer.

</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, June 28 and July 25,  1727, reporting his shipment of 6 hogsheads of tobacco on board the merchant's ship, the <i>Portland,
</i> and ordering a "hogshead of your fine Dorchester Ale" which he wants carefully bottled and packed because the last shipment was poorly packed  and was damaged. He also wants a hogshead of Southam cyder in bottles. In a lengthy post script dated July 25th, he reports bills of exchange, increases his order of the Dorchester ale, and notes that the colony has learned of the ending of the siege of Gibralter.

</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the Board of Trade, [<i>post
</i> August 17, 1727], to enclose the minutes (not present) of the recent Council meeting and to report the actions of the Indians on the frontier as well as those of the pirates in North Carolina who were captured, brought to Virginia for trial, sentenced to death, and are soon to be executed. He notes that the Council has prorogued the Assembly until the lieutentant governor, who is expected very soon, can handle more pressing matters.

</sup> <br><br><br> <br>My Lords<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what I had the Honour to write <br>you in my last, I here  inclose  the proceedings of the <br>Council on the 14th: and 15th. of June last which in <br>all probability would have  compleated  the Account <br>of my Administration, had not Some new Incidents <br>occasioned my calling another Council on the 17th: <br>instant, the Minutes whereof I hope in a Short time <br>to forward to yr. Lordships. One thing which gave <br>occasion to this Council, is a threatned invasion <br>from the Western Indians. Their pretences at first <br>was to revenge themselves of Some of our  Tributarys  <br>and the  Tuscaruros;  but having met with Some <br>Success in that Enterprize they begin to talk more <br>insolently &amp; to threaten our Frontier Inhabitants <br>but I hope the Measures projected will not only <br> disapoint  their designs, but remove them further <br> of  from our Frontiers. Another thing which <br>which hath lately happened here, is the hasty forming <br><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</a> and took and plundered <br>Several trading  Vessells  on that Coast, but before he <br>had  encreased  his Gang he was  Sett  upon by Some of <br>the Country people and taken with two more of his <br>first Gang and one  press't  man; they were Sent in <br>hither for  Tryall,  and on the 17th: instant Vedell <br>and two of his People received Sentence of Death <br>and will be speedily executed. These are the principal <br> Occurrences  since my last letter, except that upon  the <br>uncertainty of the <a href="Cbiodir.html#WG">Lieutenant Governors
</a> Arrival, I <br>have prorogued the General Assembly to the 16th: of Novr. <br>judging that  tho  his arrival Should happen as Soon <br>as may be, the General Court and other Affairs of the <br>Government will not  permitt  him to hold an <br>Assembly Sooner, nor indeed is their any imediate <br>necessity for  it's  Meeting.

</b> CO5/1320, ff 205, Public Record Office, London.  This is the recipient's copy signed by Carter as is indicated by the use of bold italics. It is endorsed: "Virginia | Lre from Mr. Carter, President | of the Council &amp; Commander in | Chief of Virginia, without Date," and "Recd Octor: 9th | Read Decr: 6: } 1727." Marginal summaries of its contents have been added by a clerk in London. As noted in its endorsement, Carter and his clerk forgot to write the date line on this letter; it has been assigned this date on the basis of evidence in the letter and from Carter's diary entries of this period.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. This letter appears in the letter book with others of this date. No letter to Perry of August 7th is extant, but a missing page in the letter book might have borne it.
</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

(  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.

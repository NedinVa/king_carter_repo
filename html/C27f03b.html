He has not heard of the arrival of Pemberton's slave ships which should have been sent earlier. Carter has drawn two bill of exchange on him payable to George Braxton for slaves that Carter was forced to buy because of many deaths among his slaves during the winter.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">John Pemberton,</a> June 3, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>June 3d: 1727<br><br>Mr. John Pemberton<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n1>Watkinson</a> Arrived here the latter End of <br> Aprill  I have  Orderd  him the Tobbo: belonging to the <a href=#n2> John and <br>Betty </a> he refuses to take any more of it but what  lyes  in <br>Corotoman I have promised him 30 hhds: of my own if he <br>does not leave me out A fortnight ago he writ me word he <br>had half his Load  <S><font color="red">my</font></S>  in, I have  presst  him mightily to take <br>in all your Tobbo: but he is a very gruff old Gentleman I <br>hear nothing yet of your two Negroes Ships It had bin Adv=<br>antageous to those  Concernd  if they had bin here in the last <br>month.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Cheif  business of this is to advise you of bills <br>of Exchange I have drawn upon you this day for three hundred <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>pounds payable to both <a href="Cbiodir.html#">George  Braxston </a> a great many o[f]</i></font></sup> <br>my Slaves have  Dyed  this winter which hath Obliged me to <br>buy Early to Supply their rooms and Occasions this large <br>Draft upon you I bought near four Score in the middle of <br> Aprill  the Choice of the Ship three men to one woman at <br>Twenty pound per head it had bin a Satisfaction to me to <br>have laid out my money with you had either of your Ships <br>got it time Enough I hope <a href=#n3>Capt:  Moreton </a> is safe with you <br>hear no news of him yet I Shall Conclude here </p><br><u>Sir</u> <br>Yor: very humble Servt:<br><br>per the Dispatch Capt Barry<br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad.

</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of 1727 May 17, Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,
</i> but little information about Bradley has been located.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The <i>Forward
</i> was a London ship of 150-200 tons  commanded in 1728-29 by William Loney, and in 1731 by George Buckridge.

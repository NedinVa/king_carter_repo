Lewis Burwell, his grandson, is to be sent to Cambridge in the spring and Perry must find a "a discreet sober Tutor" to keep Burwell at his studies, and the expences must be kept low.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Micajah Perry</a>, December 16, 172</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>  [Rappahannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>[December 16, 1727]<br><br>Mr Micajah Perry<br> <br>Sir<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By my letters from time to time you ma [y]</i> <br>conclude I was under Expectation you would pay my rent to the propr [s]</i> <br>of the northern Neck for the year 1726 and in mine  <S><font color="red">two</font></S>   four</i> days  ago  <br>I told you if you had paid the rent for the year 27 also that is to <br><a href=#n1> Michaelmas </a> last Deducting only  Colonel   Jenings  debt for &pound;<br>thirty odd pound I should not be uneasy however lest you should <br>not look upon what I have already  written  as a peremptory order <br>I do now give you positive directions forthwith to make paymen [t]</i> <br>for the  said  year 1726 and if the  proprietors  strongly in=<br>sist upon it to pay for the last years rent also that there  be</i> no foun<br>dation left for complaint Against me</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said something to you alread [y]</i> a=<br>bout the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#LL">LL</a> affair upon your information of the little  likelihood  <br>there was of a speedy disposal of it  I am  of the same opinion  men <br> tioned  to you in some former letters that I cannot reckon it  <S><font color="red">in va<br>lue</font></S>  to be worth above three  thousand  pounds and if you  are  pleased  to</i> continue <br>a bidder for me  I will give no more than that sum for the Estate lands &amp;ca.</i> &amp; I must be indulged in point of time as I have <br>already noted and care must be taken that a good title to the Lands be made to me</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1"> Colonel  Page</a> and my <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JC1">son John</a> still cont<br>inue in the Opinion of sending <a href=#n2>Lewis Burwell</a> to Cambridge and we  proposed  <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>to write a  joint  letter to you about him but our meetings are so seldom <br>and when we are together so much other business hath intervened that <br>this letter hath still been forgot It will be high time to remove him <br>thither next Spring If he hath the good fortune to be under the care of <br>a discreet sober Tutor that will keep him under a good discipline and <br>out of the way of Expences and in the improvement of his  studies  is <br> what is</i> mostly to be aimed at for my part I must leave the choice of a Tutor to <br>you what the other Gentlemen advise in the matter I shall let you know <br>hereafter you are very sensible our  commodity  is at a very low ebb at this <br>time a Sufficient reason to  induce  us to a frugality as  <br>much as possible in his Education and to allow him <br>only a decent maintenance which I hope you will endeavour with all <br>the power you have over him I am</p><br><br><br>to be copyed<br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

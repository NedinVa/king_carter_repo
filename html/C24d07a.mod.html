He alerts Holloway that his daughter Elizabeth Burwell's "imprudent and obstinate Match" with Dr. George Nicholas will likely produce some law suits as he is the guardian for the Burwell children, and is acting executor of the Burwell estate. He expects Holloway's assistance in these legal matters.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to [<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JH">John Holloway</a>], April 7, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>  [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>Aprill the 7th: 172<hi rend="underline">3 4</i></i></b> <br> <br>Sr -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our old friend <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#GE">Eskridge</a> coming to wait upon <br>the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#HD">Governour</a> in  pursuit  of the  collector's  place of  Potomac  I <br>cannot doubt you will be very ready to give him your <br>Assistance poor George hath a large family of Children  <S><font color="red">[illegible]</font></S> <br>lives very Convenient and hath indeed supported a gre [at]</i> <br>part of the Burden of that Office by his Genrosity in <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#DM">Ca [ptain]</i> <br> McCarty's </a> time,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next place I must tell you tha [t Mrs.]</i> <br><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#ECB">Burwells</a> imprudent and obstinate Match with Doc [tor]</i> <br>Nicholass I Expect will  throw  me into  several  La [w Suits]</i> <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>Upon my own Accot: As I am the Guardian to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr Burwells</a> <br>Children, And as I am his Acting Executor you have all <br>ways been my Lawyer ever Since you came into Virginia <br>and I cannot doubt but you will continue so Still to <br>Assist me in  carrying  me through these troublesome per<br>plexing Affairs with your  utmost  Vigour, I suppose <br><a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1"> Colonel Page</a> hath already been with you to fix you on our <br>Side however I have thought it not amiss to add this <br>line from Sr   </p><br>Your most Sincere Friend <br>and most humble Servt;<br><br>I forgot to tell you I <br>have  written  to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JC3">Mr. Attorney</a> <br>to prosecute an out Lawry <br>against the Murderer <a href=#n1> Thomas  <br>Glascock</a> and have told him <br>you will be ready to give him <br>your Assistance -- <br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1723 June 16-1724 April 23, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a><br><br>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a><br><br>In a letter to Attorney General John Clayton,  1724 April 7, that follows two on the same subjects in the letter book, Carter identifies his attornies as "Mr. Holloway and Mr. Randall." As one letter indicates an acquaintanceship of long standing,  it has been selected as one directed to John Holloway, and the second one to Randall.</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] "William Forrester had been murdered on November 5, 1723, by Thomas Glascock whose son Gregory was named as an accessory." Carter had noted Glascock's capture in his diary on November 13th: "Collo Barber acquaints me me he had Seizd Glascocks who had fled for Murther his Estate Coll Tarpley in the behalf of Glascocks Heir offers to Enter the Land as Escheat " The lands reverted to the proprietors, and Carter apparently managed them for some years for the benefit of Glascock's heirs; he later acquired title to the properties which are mentioned in his will.

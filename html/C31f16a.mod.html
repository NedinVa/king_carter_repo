<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Mann Page, Carter's son-in-law (husband of his daughter Judith) had died on 1731 January 24 at Rosewell,"Gloucester County, and Carter and his son John write as Page's executors.</a>

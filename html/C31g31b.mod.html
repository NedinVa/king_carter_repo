<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchants  Alderman [Micajah] Perry &amp; Company, July 31, 1731, to cover a bill of lading for tobacco sent by the estate of Mann Page, and a bill of exchange to be credited to Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell. He directs that the merchants change their accounting for the Merchants Hundred estate which they have incorrectly been handling under the name of his grandson Carter Burwell. The affairs of this estate are to be credited to his own account.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

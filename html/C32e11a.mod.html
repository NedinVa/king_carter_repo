He encloses (not present) the bill of lading and notifies Tucker of bills of exchange. He writes that he did not receive a promised account current,  orders more Dorcester ale, and sadly notes the death of his son Robert on May 6, 1732.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to Edward Tucker, May 11, 1732</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>May 11. 1732<br><br>Edward Tucker Esqr<br> <br>Sr:<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last went by the way of   Liverpool   and bore date <br>March 8  <S><font color="red">1728 and with</font></S>  This accompanys the  Portland  <a href=#n1> Captain  Russel</a> on <br>whom I have loaded 59 hogsheads  of  Stemmed   straight  laid  Tobacco  that  has  <br> passed  the fiery  trial  of our <a href=#n2>new Law</a> 44 of them my own crops and 15 <br>a Crop of <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1"> Colonel  Pages</a> I cannot doubt it rising very well to your satisfaction <br>after so Strict a Scrutiny.

" The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al. </i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. </i> </a> pp. 236-39.)</a><br><br><a name="n3">[3] The tare is the weight of the container which is deducted from the gross weight to obtain the net weight of the product held in the cotainer.</a><br><br><a name="n4">[4] By the Navigation Act of 1663 colonial governors were empowered to appoint an officer to carry out provisions of the Act, which officer "is there commonly known by the name of the naval officer." "Naval officers in British colonies in North America and the West Indies prepared shipping lists and forwarded them through the colonial governor to the Board of Trade or to the Treasury in England. The Navigation Act of 1696 established the naval officer's responsibility, to obtain detailed information regarding every ship entering and clearing in the colonial ports. The lists contain chronological entries of ships and their cargo. Information includes the date of entry or clearance, the type and name of the ship, its home port or colony, the details of the vessel's construction and registration, the name of the master and owner, the last port entered and the immediate destination, and the tonnage of the vessel "(1.

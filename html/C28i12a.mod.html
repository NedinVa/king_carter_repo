<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter sent letters by Captain Naylor in the fall of 1728, but apparently the ship was lost on its way to Liverpool because Carter noted to William Dawkins 1728 June 29, the ship "hath never been heard of."

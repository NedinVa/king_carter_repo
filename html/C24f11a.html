He adds that Scots merchants have taken much tobacco, and that the current crop will be poor in part because of the limit on plants that each man is allowed. He reports a number of bills of exchange, and alerts Pemberton that he will soon send an invoice for goods. He closes with a complaint that the slave shoes the merchant has sent are too  small.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JP">John Pemberton,</a> June 11, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per the Vine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy per Holladay<br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>June 11th. 1724 -- <br><br>Mr. John Pemberton<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by the <a href=#n1> Vine </a> Accompanys a Bill of <br>Lading for two &amp; Twenty hhds.. of leaf Tobo. which I doubt not You will <br>make as good a Dispose of as is to be had, All our Lettrs. out of England <br>give us hopes of a rising Markett <sup><font color="green">this Summer</i></font></sup> Especially for Leaf Tobacco --  &amp; if <br> Stemd   dos  not rise now twill be very Strange when You are <br>like to have no more of it, The Outports have Shrunk prodigiously <br>in their Trade, Yours hath nothing to what it  usd  to have, Bristol <br>Falls Short a great deal, Londo. hath Several Ships fewer then they <br>[had]</i></font></sup> last Year, The  Scoth  have carried off 10 or 12 thousand hhds. <br>[...]</i></font></sup> their Ships won't carry above 4 thousand hhds.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Robert Cary, August 26, 1729, to inform him of the reduced crops in the colony due to the heavy rains during the summer, and that he is not shipping tobacco because the merchant has not had a ship in the colony. He notes arrangements for financial security for his son Charles's work as naval officer of the Rappahannock.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

Carter believes the best person to replace Harrison on the Council will be John Clayton, the attorney general, who is expected back from England at any time. He adds news about his family and their and his health, Charles's trip to the falls, and concludes with affectionate greetings to his daughter and all of Page's "fireside." In a lengthy post script he notes Clayton's arrival and that he soon hopes to hear the results of Clayton's presentation to the House of Lords about the Northern Neck proprietary.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP1">Colonel Mann Page,</a> December 5, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br>D[embe]</i></font></sup>r the 5th 1727 <br>To Collo Page<br> <br>Honrble Sir<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indebted to you for two letters <br>this  cleanes  the score <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr Perry</a> in a long letter  intermixd  with  severall  <br>other subjects says what follows relating to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#NB">Mr. Burwells</a> <br>concerns which I give you in the enclosed paper in his own words the packet <br>you sent me Yesterday contains Only his invoice for the Estates goods <br>now in the <a href=#n1>Spotswood</a> which I return to you by Peter I would have <br><a href=#n2>Camp</a> copy it &amp; let me have it again</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#NH">Collo: Harrison</a> hath had death so long in <br>his view that I hope this Sudden stroke hath not found him un<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>prepared the Auditors place is worth troubling for the Salary upon <br>the Accots. last year amounted to him to near &pound;400 in the Currt: <br>Year <sup><font color="green">and is a place of little trouble</i></font></sup> perhas the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JC1">Secretary</a> may push for it and nature  <S><font color="red">will</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">would</i></font></sup> oblige me <br>to be a Solicitor for him before any other had I any interest but I have none <br>he hath <a href=#n3>Cary</a> his friend &amp; Dr. Carteret his patron the place may be  reckond  <br>incompatible with this but I cant see the reason that owing purely <br>to the force of his money the favour from the Crown was the Effect of <br>Tickells interest &amp; my son holds it by purchase</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were I to give my Opinion impartially for a person <br>to make up the breach of Collo.

Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County.

In the complimentary close, a second clerk has entered notes that the letter has been "Cpd" (Copied) with his name, and this has been indicated by italics.</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad.

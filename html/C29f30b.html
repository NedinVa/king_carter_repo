<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you were here I know you intended to<br>
be at our July Court &amp; I hope you will but  least  you should fail<br>
I can't for bear to put you in mind how poor I am how few bills of<br>
Exchange I have receiv'd this year and how low my stock of Cash is so tht.<br>
I am hardly Able to Pay my debts which I Expect Every day will be<br>
Called for and how little money I receiv'd for my <a href=#n1>Quit rents</a> this year<br>
not a third of what has been paid me for several years Past</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Consideration of these my Uncommon ne:<br>
cessitys I press you strongly to get me all the money you Can I hope<br>
you have begun prosecutions for my fines against those you have<br>
any reason to suspect will not pay without</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n2>Mr Downman</a> you told me owns to have<br>
twenty pounds of the money in his hands pray take a right method

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
to get it of him that I may have it to Answer my Present<br>
Calls And sure of my Other debts will be got this year for me</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#JC2">James Carter</a> tells me he was promised by the<br>
gentlemen of Stafford to pay their rents to the Value of &pound;100<br>
who now shuffle with him and tell him they must Pay Tobo at<br>
last I order him to sue for the money Upon their <a href=#n3>Assumpsits</a><br>
thinking my self not Obliged to take Tobo: so late in the year<br>
for their last years rents and I dare say you will be of the same<br>
of Opinion</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#WR1">Colo. Robinson</a> for All his fine promises to you hath<br>

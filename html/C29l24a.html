<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>
 London <br>
<br>Decemr 24th 1729<br><br>
Charles Carter<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received your  severall <br>
letters and congratulate you on your<br>
NavaL Office place. <a href="Cbiodir.html#EA">Mr  Athaws </a><br>
and I have given security for you<br>
here at our [omission in text]</i></font></sup> and hope you<br>
will take care that there shall never<br>
be any mistake or error.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also desire you will be very <br>
punctual and exact in doing all<br>
your business as a Merchant to be<br>
sure to endorse all your bills<br>
regular and to  give advice to what<br>
Account they are to be placed; for<br>
I shall keep your Naval Office<br>
Account distinct; and to advise<br>
whenever you draw any bills:<br>
for I will pay no bills without<br>
advice altho' I believe it may be

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
your hand. Also, draw your bills <br>
at sixty days, which gives time to <br>
be in cash if it should be otherwise. <br>
I desire you will write to me often. <br>
Your place gives you great opportu=<br>
nity of conveyance.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Tobacco Trade, it continues<br>
 bad -- the price low. Notwithstand<br>
-ing the advices we have of the dam<br>
-age the great rains have done to the last <br>
crop in Virginia, our buyers <br>
will not believe any thing until <br>
they [omission in text]</i></font></sup> a real security, which is <br>
far from with us at present.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to your Copper mine, it is <br>
likely to be a very good thing; but <br>
Mr  Athaws,  who has taken a great <br>
deal of pains in having it proved by <br>
the greatest artist, will give you a <br>
full account of what [omission in text]</i></font></sup> he knows <br>
of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	As I have had some small share in your <br>
education, so I can't forbear giving you advice <br>
and recommending to you strict virtue and <br>
integrity in every action of your life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know <a href=#n1>Mr. Heath</a> has a <br>
Country Seat. If you meet with <br>
any rarity of trees of plants, it <br>
will be an acceptable present; <br>
which is all I shall trouble you <br>
with at present, but assure you <br>
I am
</p>

<br>Your real friend &amp; humble servant.<br>
Wm. Dawkins

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:  </b></i></b>  Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. These texts are all nineteenth-century copies. Apparently there was in existence a letter book of Robert Carter's -- now lost --  and some incoming letters, from which the unknown copyist recorded these texts. As they are the only texts, the punctuation and "corrections" obviously supplied by the copyist have been retained.</a><br>

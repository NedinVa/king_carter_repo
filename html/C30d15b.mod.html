<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Captain Loxom commanded  a vessel named the <i> Loyalty
</i>in 1729-1730. (Survey Report 9727, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. See also Carter's letter to John Pemberton 1731 August 4.)

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] There  were several vessels with the name <i>Rappahannock

Another of which Charles Whate was captain was of 60 tons with 11 men in 1726 and 1727. Carter's letters mention a Captain Hugh Brackhill in 1728-1729, and Captain Loxum in 1733.

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

There are several men of the name "Brooks" in the directory including a Christopher Brooks, a ship broker, also located in Suffolk Lane.

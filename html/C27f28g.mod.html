He also wants a hogshead of Southam cyder in bottles. In a lengthy post script dated July 25th, he reports bills of exchange, increases his order of the Dorchester ale, and notes that the colony has learned of the ending of the siege of Gibralter.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbiodir.html#ET">Edward Tucker,</a> June 28 and July 25,  1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>June the. 28th: 1727<br><br>Mr. Edward Tucker<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your <a href=#n1> Portland </a> is  gone  to York to fill up I have <br>Six  hogsheads  of my Crop  tobacco  on board her which Sent you a bill of Lading <br>had Russell been at liberty to  have</i> Sent a Sloop for this  tobacco  he might have <br>got  ready  for this Fleet I must desire you to Send me in the next year <br>in one of your Ships a hogshead of your fine Dorchester Ale well and <br>Carefully bottled  off  and under very good Package Your Master <br><a href=#n2>Britt</a> will tell you how I was abused in the last.

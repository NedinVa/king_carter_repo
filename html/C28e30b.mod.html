</i> <br><br>May 30th: 1728<br><br>Mr. John Pemberton<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I recollect right Some former Letters of <br>yours  Showed  your distastisfaction to the Clause in the <a href=#n1>Act of  Parliament .
</a> <br>laying us under a prohibition from  Stemming  our  Tobacco  the Con<br>Sequence of which <sic corr="has"> has  [sic]  so very bad Effects upon us that I cant <br> believe  you Entertain any better Opinion of the restraint  than  <br>you had when it was laid on. This Country in general are So <br>very  Sensible  of this great  Evil  that <sic corr="we"> we  [sic]  have  Joined  all our <br> Endeavors  to get the liberty of  Stemming   allowed  to us again. The <br> Council  and Burgesses have  addressed  his Majesty have made <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>Application to the  Parliament  and have Send home an Agent <br>to  Solicit  the Affair. Most of the  Gentlemen  of figure in the Country <br>I  believe  will Invite the  Merchants  both of London &amp; the Outports to <br> Join  their Interest with us. The North  Britains  if  we  <br>may give any Credit to their  Merchants  here, are heartily <br>for the taking  off  this restraint and will be Zealous in getting <br>it effected. The damage to the trade in general as well as to the <br>Planter Seems very demonstrable by the low mean price tht. <br> Tobacco  runs at which  we  Conclude is mainly owing to the Abun<br>dance of Trash tht. is now  Shipped   off  <S><font color="red">which
</font>
</S>   and
</i>  we  can See no way <br>to prevent but by  Stemming  our under  Tobacco   Separateing  the <br>good and heaving the bad away which you know used <br>to be more valuable  than  the best leaf, Whereas now the <br>current practices to  tie  up all the ground and  Scruffy  leaves <br>into bundles and Sell it at half price, Indeed none is so <br>bad but it will Sell for Something or other and its become <br>very Customary for a planter where he  lays  out his Crop <br>to oblige the  Merchants  to take  off  2 or 3 hogsheads of his under  Tobacco  <br>Else he will not deal with him for the rest  These things you will have the full information of from yor: own  Masters 
</i> This Scroby <br> Tobacco   we  beleive  is most of it either Clandestinly run with <br>out paying Custom or Sent abroad in both Cases the Crown <br>is no Gainer, and if this can be demonstrated and all the <br> Merchants  will go heartily into it  we  Entertain our Selves <br>with great hopes to meet with  relief  according to  our  wishes <br>and I flatter my Self you will be one of the Forwardest in <br> <S><font color="red">ptomot

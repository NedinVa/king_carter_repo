<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Carter had built a fine house at Corotoman in the mid 1720s, but it burned in January 1729.  See the <i>Maryland Gazette</i> for 1728/29 February 4-11 for information about Carter's loss.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Thomas Woodward commanded the <i>Providence,</i> a ship owned by Captain John Hyde &amp; Company, during a number of voyages to the colony, 1723-1729. ( Survey Report 6800 summarizing Adm. 68/194 and Survey Report 6801 summarizing Adm 68/195, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia,</a> and Carter's letter to the firm, 1723 September 17.)</a>

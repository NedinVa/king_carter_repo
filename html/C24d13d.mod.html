He reminds Savage that Thomas Barber is to assist with the work, and Carter is sending to Savage by Barber some deeds for lands in the area of Bull Run. Some surveys were made in the area ten years earlier, but Savage is to ignore them.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>John Savage,</a> April 13, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>  [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>Aprill the 1<u>3th. 17234</u> <br>Mr: Jno.

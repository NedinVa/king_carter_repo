"He settled at Marlboroughtown [in then Stafford County] in 1726 as a practicing attorney and at once allowed a facile pen to get him into trouble with the government." He eventually lost his license to practice law, and turned to the land speculation that he had begun as soon as he reached Virginia. "He married first on June 10, 1725 Catherine Mason (June 21, 1707-June 15, 1750) only child of Colonel George Mason (16??-1716) and his second wife Elizabeth Waugh, daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Waugh."(<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William</i>  p. 315;</a>  <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B24">Copeland and MacMaster.  <i>The Five George Masons.</i> </a>; and "John Mercer."  http://www.rootsweb.com/~vastaffo/johnmercer.htm  11/4/03)</a>

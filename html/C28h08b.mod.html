Mr. Wm: Dawkins<br>
 
<br>Sir -- <br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am taking my leave of the <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter 
</a> a final on [e]  <br>I almost think concluding the Owners will never have the patience <br>to undergo any more  losing  Voyages, poor D [ove]  can best tell <br>you the misfortunes he  has  been under him [self and]  of the Gout <br>that kept him \Confined to the Ship I think  [...]

and the baseness of the Officers he has had under him, worse I  believe  <br>Master was never plagued withall you had better given Young <br>Baggwell &pound;50  than  let him Set his foot into her, they Seem all to <br>be pretty much of a piece. The Boatswain, Seems to be the best among <br>them I think in my Conscience had the Ship been under brisk man=<br>agement and a lively brisk  Driving
</i> leader She would have fared abundance <br>better and her dispatch been a great deal quicker I have a very good <br>Friendship for  Captain  Dove and would Say nothing to his disadvan=<br>tage I esteem him an honest man and that he  has  Exerted his <br>utmost in the Service he is in and yet I cannot but be of Opoinion <br> <S><font color="red">but

 Enough in this river <br>Several hundreds of hogsheads  have  been  carried  to York, which I am <br>not capable to give a  Reason  for when so good a Ship in the river <br>was ready to Serve them, pray God Send her well home and  [I]  <br>Shall  Endeavor  to be  easy  let what will become of her, for I shall <br>never desire to See her again unless She comes under a better prospect <br>If She be  really  a Sound firm ship could be made an Early one <br>and put under vigorous  management  there might be hopes  <S><font color="red">of her
</font>
</S>  <br> <S><font color="red">doing better

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:
</b>
</i>
</b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. The leaf of the letter book on which this letter was written has some marginal damage and a missing portion at the bottom.
</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

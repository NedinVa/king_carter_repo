<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. Because the draft extended near the bottom of the letter book page, the clerk did not separate the close from the text.</a>

<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the heading on this draft.</a>

<br><br>Carter wrote to his son-in-law, Mann Page, <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-carter?id=C29b11b.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/web/data/users/berkeley&tag=public" target="_wblank">this same day</a> noting that he sends his letter to the governor by Charles, and has left it open so that Page can decide whether to send it or not. The minutes of a meeting of the Council held 1729 November 1 show that Charles did replace his brother as naval officer of the Rappahannock.

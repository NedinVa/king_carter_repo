He comments on freight rates, the quality of his tobacco, and on 3 hogsheads that are poor because of a "Notorious rogue" of an overseer. He turns to the misfortune of Captain Adam Graves who has been ill and unable to seek cargo for his ship although he has now recovered, and notes that he  has made two large sloops available to Graves for moving tobacco to the ship. In conclusion, he adds that all the planters in the colony are expecting very good prices for their last shipments of stemmed tobacco.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#WD">William Dawkins,</a> February 13, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>The other Book<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per Keiling Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>Feb. 13th. 1723/4 -- <br><br>Mr. Wm.

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. Both pages of this letter have suffered considerable damage including large sections missing along their margins.</a>

<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft. Carter has added the close in his own hand as is indicated by the use of italics.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The London ship  <i>Williamsburgh</i> was a large vessel of 550 tons and carried a crew of 26 men. Charles Rogers commanded her in 1727-29.  ( Adm 68/195, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of 1727 May 17, Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,</i> but little information about Bradley has been located. (There is a listing of the firm of Bradly &amp; Griffin, Merchants, Fenchurch-street, opposite the Mitre Tavern, on page 13 of   <i>Kent's Directory For the Year 1740 Containing An Alphabetical List of the Names and Places of Abode of the Directors of Companies, Persons in Publick Business, Merchants, and other Eminent Traders in the Cities of London and Westminster, and the Borough of Southwark.</i>   London: Printed and Sold by Henry Kent in Finch-Lane, near the Royal Exchange: and by the Booksellers and Pamphlets Shops of London and Westminster, 1740. http://freepages.history.rootsweb.com/~frpayments/KD1740/AB.htm. 8/12/2005. p. 39.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] The Sarah was a 120 ton London vessel with a crew of 13 commanded by John Reynolds in 1728 and 1729.  ( Adm 68/194 and 195,  found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] There was a ferry over the Piankatank River near Berkeley Island operated by Bailey Seaton that Carter often refers to when describing trips to Williamsburg. The Seaton property is noted on the Fry-Jefferson map as on the Piankatank in Gloucester County.</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful.

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Rosewell in Gloucester County was the Page home.</a>

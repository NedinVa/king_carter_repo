He understands that the <i>Carter</i> and also Captain Richardson are on their way to the colony, but fears they will find it impossible to get good cargoes. In closing, he notes that Captain Adam Graves will not be able to fully load before he must sail.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Micajah Perry,</a> March 6, 1724</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other Book --  Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Mar 6. 1723/[4]<br><br>Mr. Micajh Perry<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is  design'd  by the  Burwell  <a href=#n1>Capt.

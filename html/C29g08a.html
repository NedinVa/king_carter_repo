<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Gale was a Glasgow merchant about whom has little been discovered. Carter would write him several times in the period 1727-1729.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter noted in his diary 1727 January 19 the arrival of the <i>Mazareen</i> at his house and a visit from her captain, Richard Kelsick, four days earlier. </a>

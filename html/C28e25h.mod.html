</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to Weymouth merchant Edward Tucker, May 25, 1728, to report the arrival of Captain Willson after a long voyage via Antigua, several bills of exchange, Captain Brett's inability to take his tobacco, and his hope that Willson will be able to carry it. The bulk of the letter is devoted to persuading Tucker, a member of the House of Commons, to support the colony's desire to repeal the act of Parliament probhibiting the importation of stemmed tobacco into England. In a post script dated July 8th, Carter notes that he plans to send 30 hogsheads of tobacco in Captain Willson's ship, reports bills of exchange, and orders beer, malt, and ale.

</i> <br><br>May the 25th: 1728<br><br>Edward Tucker Esqr.<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round about Voyage by the way of <br>  Antigua   <a href=#n1> Captain  Willson
</a> came Safe in at last, I had Some damage <br>in my Beer Necessity forced him in his long passage to refresh <br>his men and himself with Some of it; but that he and I shall <br>Accommodate,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein Send you a bill of Exchange of <a href=#n1><a href=#n2> Thomas  Edwards 
</a>
</a><br>for &pound;13:12:3:d Also John Kirks for &pound;8"9:11 both on your Self <br>which desire Credit for,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n3> Captain  Brett
</a> soon after his coming in Spoke to me <br>for Some freight, Accordingly I promised him, but the number of <br>hhds: I could not then tell, I was a long time kept from home at <br>our Assembly and General Court, he sent two Sloops into our <br>parts, the last was after I got home and might have taken in <br>Some of my  Tobacco  but he had Some better  friends  to pleasure <br>I Suppose and so left me totally out  Captain  Willson I intend to <br>ship upon if he  does  not Serve me as Brett  has  done he  has  <br>Sent me word he will be with me in a few days when we Shall <br>Adjust that matter,
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the general Opinion of the  Gentlemen  in the Country <br>that the great Occasion of sending of so much Trash and under <br> Tobacco  is by the restraint  we  are under from  Stemming  for now all <br>the ground leaves and under  Tobacco  are  tied  up and go to market <br>none is so bad but the Outports  Merchants  and the North  Britains  <br>will buy at Some Price or other which  we  reckon Computing <br>through the Country amounts to Several thousand hogsheads and does <br>very much depress the market for the better Sort of  Tobacco  Whereas <br>if the good were  picked  out by  Stemming  it would be as  Valuable  <br>as the best  Tobacco   we  make.  We  think so much of the Trash of our <br> Tobacco  going home is no advantage to the King in his Customs <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>and greatly to the damage of  Merchant as well as the Planter in depress<br>ing the Price of all  Tobacco  for we Conclude this under Scruby under <br> Tobacco  is either Clandestinely run or Serves the Export trade either <br>way no Custom is paid for it. The Country in general is so deep<br>ly  Sensible  of this great  Evil  that the  Council  and Burgesses <br>have  addressed  the King and made Application to the  Parliament  <br>for the repealing of the Clause in the <a href=#n4>Act of  Parliament 
</a> prohibit<br>ing  Stemming,  And we have  Employed  Mr. <a href="Cbiodir.html#JR">John Randolph

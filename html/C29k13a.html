 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to Micajah Perry, November 13, 1729</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, November 13, 1729, to notify Perry that he is unable to locate the most recent accounts that Perry had sent for his own and the Burwell estate, and requesting new copies. He adds that his clerk, John Harvey, has recently completed his indenture, and Carter, who does not think much of his honesty, suspects he may  have taken the missing accounts. He orders some goods.</p>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  Carter had a clerk named John Harvey, and there are notes on some of his letters, "Harvey to copy." A John Harvey witnessed his will, and some of its codicils, which is logical if Harvey had written it out for Carter.</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Jesuit's bark "is the most celebrated specific remedy for all forms of malaria. It is obtained from several species of the genus cinchona . . . that have been discovered at different times and are indigenous in the Western Andes of South America. Formerly the bark itself, prepared in different forms, was used as a drug. . . " ( "Jesuit's Bark," in  <i>The Catholic Encyclopedia </i> online at  http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08372b.htm. 8/29/2005.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2]  "The root of several species of Rheum, used much as a cathartic medicine," and also in cooking.  (  <i>On-line Medical Dictionary. </i> Published at the Dept. of Medical Oncology, University of Newcastle upon Tyne. http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?rhubarb.</a>)

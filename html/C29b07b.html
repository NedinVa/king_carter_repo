<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the heading on this draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Mercer (1704-1768) emigrated from Ireland where he had been trained as an attorney. "He settled at Marlboroughtown [in then Stafford County] in 1726 as a practicing attorney and at once allowed a facile pen to get him into trouble with the government." He eventually lost his license to practice law, and turned to the land speculation that he had begun as soon as he reached Virginia. "He married first on June 10, 1725 Catherine Mason (June 21, 1707-June 15, 1750) only child of Colonel George Mason (16??-1716) and his second wife Elizabeth Waugh, daughter of the Reverend Mr. John Waugh."(<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William</i>  p. 315;</a>  <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B24">Copeland and MacMaster.  <i>The Five George Masons.</i> </a>; and "John Mercer."  http://www.rootsweb.com/~vastaffo/johnmercer.htm  11/4/03)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] John Warner was the surveyor of King George County in 1727; he laid off the town of Falmouth in 1728. Later he worked for Lord Fairfax, and prepared an important map of his holdings. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison,   <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William</i> , 626-628.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] streams</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Quit rent was the term used for the payment due from the holder of land to the "lord of the manor," in this case, to the proprietors of the Northern Neck. Carter as the proprietor's agent, collected these payments. No services were required of the landholder as had been true in mediaeval times.</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] William Hall, a resident of Stafford County to whom <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/browse-carter?id=C29b07a.xml&images=images/modeng&data=/web/data/users/berkeley&tag=public" target="_wblank">Carter wrote the same day.</a></a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] The Occaquan River is a major tributary of  the Potomac River that lay in Stafford County in Carter's day. Much of the river today is known as the Bull Run, and forms the boundary between Fairfax and Prince William counties, and to the west, between Loudoun and Prince William  counties.</a>

<br><br><a name="n7">[7] A caveat is a  "formal notice filed with a court or officer to suspend a proceeding until filer is given a hearing . . .  a warning against certain acts." ( "Meaning of CAVEAT." hyperdictionary. http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary.</a>)</a>

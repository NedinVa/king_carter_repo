</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to William Robertson, June 21, 1727, clerk of the Council, giving him information about the plan for the convoying of the merchant ships in the colony as they sail for Britain, and requesting that he be sent all the public papers so that he can see that they are sent off with the fleet. He is especially concerned that the "Order for the Embargo Should go."

There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. The unknown copyist recorded this text probably from the letter book which is used here as the copy text. 
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a nineteenth-century copy of this letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Thhe numerous parens seem to havve been entered by Carter's clerk, but probbably for some other reason than parenthetical expressions because they are not used to enclose sets of words.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] James Bradley was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt from at least 1723 until his death. As noted in his letter to Bradley of 1727 May 17, Bradley owned the <i>Welcome,</i> but little information about Bradley has been located.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] A close stool was a type of toilet with a padded seat and a removal pan beneath.</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Shalloon is a closely woven woolen used chiefly for linings. ( "Of Silk, Cotton, Linen and Wool."  18c New England Life: Clothing &amp; Accoutrements. http://www.18cnewenglandlife.org/18cNEL/ofsilk.htm. 1/8/04</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1729 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission would be successful.   ( Arthur Pierce Middleton.  <i>Tobacco Coast:  A Maritime History of the Chesapeake Bay in the Colonial Era.</i>  [Newport News, VA: Mariners' Museum, 1953.] p. 116.</a>)</a>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 22d Instant the partners in the <br>
<a href=#n1>Frying company</a> wrote to  you   joint  letter of that Affair I have only a <br>
 <S><font color="red">Small</font></S>   Short</i> line to add <a href=#n2>Tom Dove</a>  has  a Sample of the last ore we  received  <br>
I have had no fresh Accot from our general Overseer there but I have <br>
 received  one from another who writes from a Court  abt 25 miles off Frying pan</i> on the 23d. Instant <br>
Acquainting me that a person just come from thence told him that <br>
our miners the Week before had  raised  three tonns of that rich ore <br>
who told him he would give &pound;50 a  ton  for it here in the Country <br>
this was one Shaw a refiner who we had in our business for a year &amp; a <br>
half before the miners came in this I  believe  you will take for a

<a href=#n3>Rodamantade</a> as I do giving large grains of Allowance Yet cannot <br>
forbear Conceiving there is so much in it to add Pinions to the <br>
Wings of Our Expectations. I have sent up a  Schooner  a small Vessel <br>
of the Companys bought for that Service for a load of ore if so much be <br>
got down to the Landing her return will enable me to give you a more <br>
Certain Accot of the truth of these  Stories.  At Present I know not of any <br>
Opportunity to send some  barrels</i> of this ore to  you  this Shipping You may <br>
 believe  if this Vein does not prove illusive to us whe   [<i>sic</i>]</i> shall push <br>
our Work with our  Utmost  Zeal. I thought this further hint <br>
would not be unentertaining to you</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have loaded on board the Bailey Sixty Seven Barrels <br>
of the Ore We had by us as you have been already  advised   we reckon about 21000 weight</i> a bill of Lading <br>
for it you have herein to save freight it is shot into the <a href=#n4>Run</a> of the <br>
Ship She is not  hindered  in her Loading by it one hogshead of tobacco We do not <br>
expect it is very rich but we flatter  ourselves  it will do Something <br>
more than pay freight &amp; Charges I have already  written  an answer <br>
to  your  Paragraph relating to  Captain  Dove  &amp;</i> am

<br>Sir<br> 
Your very humble Servant.

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1731 July 9-1732 July 13 , Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. There is a 19th-century transcript of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful. (<a href="Cbibl.html#">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.</i>  pp. 18-19;</a> and <a href="Cbibl.html#">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .</i>  p. 342. </a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The <i>Bailey</i> was a London ship owned by William Dawkins and commanded at various times by Adam Graves (1725-1730) and by Thomas Dove (1731-1732). She was a vessel of some 250 tons and carried 15-17 crew members. ( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, 156v, and other data in Adm. 68/194 and /196, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia;</a> A letter of Carter's executors to Dawkins 1738 May 10 refers to "your ship Bailey.")</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] According to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary,</i> a "rodomontade" is "a vainglorious brag or boast; an extravagantly boastful or arrogant saying or speech."</a>

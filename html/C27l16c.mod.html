</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, December 16, 1727, to alert him that the governor has renewed his son Robert's appointment as naval officer, and that he wishes Dawkins once again to join with merchant Robert Cary in being Robert's security in England. He notifies Dawkins that the Surveyor General of Customs in the southern colonies, Richard Fitzwilliams, desires to have the naval officer located at Urbanna where the collector of customs is located, and asks Dawkins to oppose this move if Fitzwilliams pushes it at home. In a lengthy post script dated February 20, 1728, Carter comments on Isaac Lee's debt to Dawkins and his attempts to collect it for the merchant, recommends Dawkins forget about collecting other debts, notes that the <i>Carter 
</i> will once again be late in reaching the colony which will affect the business she can expect, and complains that Dawkins has not sold his tobacco.

Carter inserted in his hand a long addition to the draft at the beginning of the second paragraph as is indicated by the use of italics.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br><a name="n1">[1] As Surveyor General of the Customs in the colonies in "South America," Richard Fitzwilliams was a member of the councils of Virginia, South Carolina, and Jamaica. He had come to Virginia in 1717, and "powerful political friends quickly brought him the post of collector of customs in the lower James River district and then his . . . position as surveyor general and elevation to the Council in 1725." He served with William Byrd on  the commission to survey the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina in 1728. (<a href="Cbibl.html#B27">Billings. <i>et al.

</a><br><br><a name="n2">[2] Urbanna was a town in Middlesex County built on lands orginally owned by Ralph Wormeley who resisted the idea after the town was  authorized by the act of 1680. But development began after his death in 1701 and the passage of the third town act in 1706. ( John W. Reps,  <i>Tidewater Towns: City Planning in Colonial Virginia and Maryland.

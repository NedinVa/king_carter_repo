<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] It is not clear what Carter means by this word which appears twice in this letter. It can be used as an abbreviation for Exeter which is not far from Lyme Regis where Burridge lived. </a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] This may be Will Read, captain of an unnamed ship that Carter referred to in a letter to John Burridge 1727 July 28.</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] Nathaniel Gundry was a merchant in Lyme Regis, Dorset, and mayor of that town several times. His son was a member of Parliament and later a judge. (Notes made by Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., from   George Robert.  <i>History and Antiquities of the Borough of Lyme Regis &amp; Charnmouth.</i>  [London, 1834]. pp. 97, 383-4.</a>; and        <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B6">Sedgwick.  <i>The History of Parliament . . .

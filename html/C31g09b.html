<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Richard Oswald (1687-1766) was a prominent Glasgow merchant who was "involved in West Indies and Madeira trade as well as tobacco importation." In partnership with his brother Alexander, the firm owned three ships (the <i>Martha,</i> the <i>Amity,</i> and the <i>Speedwell</i>) of the 41 sailing from Glasgow in 1735.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] The <i>Martha</i>  was commanded by a Captain Dunlop and owned by Richard Oswald &amp; Company; see Carter to Richard Oswald &amp; Company 1729 August 11, and Carter to Oswald, 1731 July 27.</a>

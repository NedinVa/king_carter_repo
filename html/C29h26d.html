<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Falconar (d. <i>ca.</i> 1729) was a London merchant with whom Carter dealt. In 1728, Falconar and Henry Darnell formed an association of 29 London tobacco merchants to deal with the French tobacco purchasing agent as a group in order to keep the price as high as possible. The association lasted only lasted a year or two before dissolving because some of its members were dealing directly with the French agent and selling below the agreed-upon price. (See Carter to William Dawkins, and Carter to Falconar's executors, both 1730 April 16, for Falconar's death date.

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Parliament had passed an act forbidding the importation of stemmed tobacco in 1722. John Randolph was sent to England in 1729 as agent for Virginia to try to have the act overturned; his mission would be successful.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] John Pratt was a London merchant and an old friend of Carter's who usually referred to him as "Daddy."</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <i>Booth</i> in 1723-1724, and the <i>Amity,</i> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary for June 1723.

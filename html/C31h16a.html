 Rap[pahannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br>
<br>August 16. 1731<br><br>
Edward Tucker Esqr.<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already  writ  to you at large by Sever=<br>
al ways and Advis'd you of the drafts I have this year made<br>
upon you and if I forget not in a former letter sent for a<br>
hogshead of your Dorset  ail  to be put into Bottles as usual However<br>
for fear I have omitted it I now repeat that desire to you</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now under the power of the <a href=#n1>tobacco law</a><br>
which  hath  put the Ships in a great deal of hurry to get their<br>
tobacco on board in time and yet our latest advices out of England<br>
speak very doubtfully whether  twill  be allow'd to stand or no<br>
indeed it will create such abundance of trouble to us Planters<br>
and heave the country into such great Charges that abundance<br>
wish it had never been made but we must submit to the directions<br>
of our Legislators Unless a  Controul  comes from your side I am 
</p>

<br>Sir<br>
Your most Humble Servant

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] The tobacco inspection act of  1730 was introduced and steered through the legislature by Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch. " The "bill called for the inspection and bonding at public warehouses of all tobacco shipped abroad; for the destruction of all unacceptable tobacco; for standardization of the size of hogsheads . . . ; for maintenance of detailed records to prevent smuggling; and for the circulation of warehouse receipts as legal tender in lieu of tobacco iteself. . . ." Gooch also managed to obtain approval of the act in England. It went into effect 1731 August 1.(<a href="Cbibl.html#">Billings. <i>et al. </i>  <i>Colonial Virginia: A History. </i> </a> pp. 236-39.)</a>

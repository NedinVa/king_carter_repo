<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the heading on this draft. </a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Captain James Bradby commanded the <i>Micajah and Philip. </i>( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, ff. 74v, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Peter Wills commanded the  <i>Booth</i> in 1723-1724, and the <i>Amity,</i> a vessel of 500 tons and 21 men,  in 1727-1729. He is mentioned in Carter's diary for June 1723.

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11.   <i>Virginia Tax Records.</i>  [Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, Inc., 1983.] p. 539.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4]  Carter Burwell (1716-1756) was Robert Carter's grandson by his daughter Elizabeth (Carter) Burwell and her first husband, Nathaniel Burwell (1680-1721). Carter Burwell would live at "Carter's Grove," and would marry Lucy Grymes in 1738. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B3">Carleton.  <i>A Genealogy. . .  of Robert Carter. . . .</i>  p. 128.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful.

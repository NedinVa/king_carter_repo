The <i>Carter</i> must look for freight at &pound;8 if she is to be loaded, but she is doing well thanks to his assistance. He wishes her captain, Bailey Kent, were more aggressive in seeking cargo. He complains about the pirates and the Crown's apparent lack of interest in protecting the colonial trade. </p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">William Dawkins,</a> May 27, 1721</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br><br>May the. 27th 1721<br><br>Mr. Wm.

</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Micajah Perry, June 2, 1727, noting that captains Hopkins and Woodward sailed without waiting for the convoy, and that they had carried letters telling Perry that Carter would not deal with him further unless he rectified Carter's complaints. Perry had written Carter in March that they should once again pursue the purchase of John Lloyd's Virginia estates (which Carter is managing), and Carter agrees but states that the value has fallen because of the great loss of slaves. Perry should first be aware that Carter is calling on his accounts with him for nearly &pound;500 to pay for slaves he has purchased, but Perry may offer &pound;3000 for the estate with the former conditions. If Perry is to pay the last year's rent for the Northern Neck proprietary, he should deduct Edmund Jenings's debt, and see that it is paid to Carter to whom it is due. Carter informs Perry that merchant Robert Cary will attempt to recover failed merchant Thomas Evans's debts to Carter.

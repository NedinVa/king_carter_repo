 Rappa [hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>
<br>July. 8th [1729]<br><br>
Mr John Stark<br>
 
<br>Sir<br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes by <a href=#n2> Captain  Bowman</a> in the <br>
 Lucia  with a bill of Lading for 32 hogsheads  of  Tobacco </i> on her <br>
By her I  received  your long letter with your several  Accounts  of <br>
Sales and Invoice with the goods  Ordered  You take up a <br>
great deal of room to demonstrate to me the regularity of <br>
your Accounts  and how fair you are in giving me all the Advan:<br>
tages of my money in your hands that I have a right to <br>
but I must profess to you I have so great a cloud upon my <br>
Understanding that I can by no means  discover</i> the forces of your reas<br>
oning the Facts I think are plainly of my side And they carry <br>
a full demonstration with them first you Charge me with all <br>
the duty and then you discharge  it All</i> on the Credit side and After <br>
All sell my Tobacco for Export without allowing me one farthing <br>
of the discounts given to the ready payer and yet raising  your 

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>
Commission upon the Amount of the Credit side which <br>
is  bulked  up to a large sum by the  duties  making your com:<br>
mission twice as much as it would be if you were to  raise  it <br>
only upon your Export sales And this way I am a great suff<br>
erer and never saw this way  practiced   until  of late years you <br>
 Justify  your self under the method of Other  Merchants  I must <br>
confess you are not the Only Person that makes this the method <br>
of your Accounts  but whether it be right in any of you to  raise  <br>
your Commision upon the whole duty when you bond it and none <br>
of the money is Ever out of your hands  is the question I want Satisfaction in</i> this is a practice <br>
that  has  been  fallen  upon but of late  years  my  Accounts  for<br>
merly where my Tobacco was Sold to Export were never troubled <br>
with the  duties  Either of the Debtor or Credit side</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You tell me you do me a great deal of service in <br>
keeping my Tobacco thus long upon  your  Stands I should be <br>
glad to find this good Effect from it but your  Accounts  make <br>
out just the Contrary in all of them your latest sales are <br>
Considerably the lowest thus I shall wait for your Answer to <br>
these Plain facts</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein I send you an Invoice of some goods which <br>
request you will send me next year as  Per  Directions I have  desireed  <br>
 Captain  Bowman to bring me in some bottles and have  directed  <br>
him to receive the money from you to Pay for them I request  you  <br>
will let him have it Accordingly</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein send  you  two bills of  Exchange  drawn on  your self <br>
<a href="Cbiodir.html#RC2">Robert Carter  junior </a> for &pound;22"0"0 <a href="Cbiodir.html#NS">Nicholas Smith</a> for &pound;7"4 <br>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Stark was a merchant, probably the one to whom Carter referred when he wrote to Micajah Perry on 1723 July 4 that he had drawn an order on "Mr. Stark of Glasgow." On that same day, he wrote to a John Stark, referring to Captain Bowman.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Captain Samuel Bowman commanded the <i>Lucia.</i> Carter mentioned this vessel in his diary in June 1724, and again on 1726 March 4 when he wrote that she "came in had 20 Weeks Passage."</a>

He was surprised that the English opinions concerning the rights of the proprietors of the Northern Neck to certian fees had yielded rights that Carter had never considered part of the grant. His son Charles has visited Page's settlement and found that it was ready for occupancy. Charles had planned to cross the Shenandoah but the waters were too high. He comments on the governor's position concerning the vacant auditor's place, the bad news concerning his grandson, Lewis Burwell, and that he has directed Micajah Perry to send Burwell to Cambridge in the spring. He concludes that he is sending his daughter all the chocolate nuts he can spare, and hopes that she will have a successful childbirth.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to Colonel <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1">Mann Page,</a> December 22, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> [Corotoman, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>Decemr 22d: 1727<br><br>Collo Page<br> <br>Honble: Sir<br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am  thank full  to you for your news and <br> beleive  it tired you  hartily  <sup><font color="green">to write so much</i></font></sup> your refuge must be to do as I am  forct  <br>to write by another hand</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall make no reflections on the proceed<br>ings of the Council only that they <sup><font color="green">were</i></font></sup> very extraordinary and none knows <br>how far the consequence will sting but <sup><font color="green">as</i></font></sup> the hands of Governours are <br>tyed up by their instructions from receiving presents from the Country <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>its probable the Councils will too in time</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suspicious humor made me expect <br>greater alterations in the Attorney generals Opinion than I find <br>the fines by Act of Assembly I never pretended to and the <a href=#n1>felo<br>deses</a> I had his Opinion before were not Granted but by ex<br>press words so that the crown <sup><font color="green">have</i></font></sup> got nothing but <sup><font color="green">what</i></font></sup> I would readily <br>have <a href=#n2>yielded</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n3>Charles</a> was at Your settlement both <br>he and <a href="Cbiodir.html#RJ">Jones</a> who was with me last week agree that your Over<br>seers house &amp; quarter would both be finished by last Saturd<br>ay so that you may plant Your people there as soon as <br>you think fit  <S><font color="red">Charles had</font></S>  for the Other buildings that <br>w <S><font color="red">ould</font></S> <sup><font color="green">ill </i></font></sup>be necessary for the plan: I think I shall be able to <br>do  <S><font color="red">them</font></S>  for you before they will be wanted</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles had the courage to see  chenan <br>doah but the waters were too high for him to pass it to the <br>other side where the greatest body of good land  lyes  he is very <br>particular in the relation of his travels but that must be <br>the  <S><font color="red">work</font></S>  <sup><font color="green">entertainment</i></font></sup> of Another time Charles will best divert you with <br>it himself</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the Govr: hath taken the most<br>prudent way in respect to the auditors place to disabli=<br>ge none I am Sorry the Assembly is to be held in the winter se=<br>ason The very bad story you tell me of <a href=#n4>Lewis Burwell</a> is a very gre<br>at Affliction to me If I knew how to help it I have ordered <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Mr. <br>Perry</a> by this  Leverpool  ship to send him to Cambridge in the <br>spring which hath been your advice All along and have pre<br>st him with great earnestness to be  carefull  in his choice of <br>a proper tutor</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sent <a href="Cbiodir.html#JCP">my Daughter</a> 20 pounds <br>of chocolate nuts which is all I can well spare  altho  if <br>these will not do before you can recruit I will let you have <br>some more <a href=#n5>Mrs Wormeley</a> lately had as much from me</p><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>3</i>-</center><br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray god Grant my daughter a happy <a href=#n6>minuit</a> this <br>family salutes you with their proper  complyments  all <br> joyn  in our wishes for a Merry Christmass to you my <br>kind love &amp; respects to my Daughter &amp; children I am <br>glad to hear they are got well again my eyes continue <br>as bad as ever &amp; my Other Maladies persecute me every <br>night this cold weather hath kept me in the house that I <br>could not ride out these many days I am</p><br><br><br><br><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.

Charles would live at "Cleve," King George County, and inherit a number of properties in that area from his father.

He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, and inherited considerable property, living at "Fairfield," Gloucester County. He would be president of the Council in 1750-1751.

No other possible word has been discovered, however. Carter may refer to the impending birth of Judith (Carter) Page's last child, a daughter who apparently died soon after her birth in 1728.

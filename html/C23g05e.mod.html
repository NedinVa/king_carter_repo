He reviews the arrangements for Robin's return to the colony if he has not already sailed because merchant William Dawkins has kept Robin longer in England than Carter intended. He concludes that Robin's brother Charles may return with him or stay as he chooses.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Robert Carter, Jr.,</a> July 5, 1723</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br>  [Rappahannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i> <br>July the 5th. <u>1723</u> <br> <br>My Dear Son Robin --  -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems you were out of the way way when the <br><a href="Cbiodir.html#">Carter</a> left   London    so I had no Letter from you, I Expected you <br>in the last Fleet with Mr. Pratt, but <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr. Dawkins</a>  has   <br>kept you  beyond   my orders, his last Letter tells me he <br>would take the first good  opportunity   to send you away <hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2</i>-</center><br><br>so that I am in Expectations of you every day</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Dawwkins give [s] </i> you a very good word and <br>flatters me I shall not repent the money you have sp [ent]</i> <br>me at the School he sent you to after you came from <br><a href=#n1>Mr. Lows</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am apt to think you will be come away <br>before this  reaches   you, but if not my  positive   Orders <br>are to Mr. Dawkins that he send you into me in the <br>first good Ship bound out for our River if the Carter <br>be as forward in her coming away as any of the rest, I <br>had rather you should come with <a href=#n2> Captain   Graves </a> than   any <br>body Else, These orders I now send to you also ch [arg]</i>ing <br>you upon your duty upon any pretence whatsoever not <br>to disobey them, pray God send you a good  voyage   and <br>grant us a happy meeting</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Cbiodir.html#">Charles</a> if he has an Inclination  <S><font color="red">either to come <br>along with you</font></S>  I have left it to his own choice   <S><font color="red">or to be <br>sent away next Spring</font></S>  either to come along with you <br>or to be sent away next Spring I am</p><hr><center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center><br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1723 July 4-1724 June 11, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. </a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent a copy of this letter by the  "Spotswood"  who sailed hence a few days ago, which I enclosed to <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP1"> Colonel   Page
</a> and desired he would forward  it to you. In that letter is the <a href=#n1>piece of copper 
</a>received from Dr. [Shaw]. I have heard nothing from him since.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="Cbiodir.html#CS"> Carter Frigate 
</a> is safe arrived, but 300 hogsheads short of her loading, a circumstance which will determine her owners to put an  [end to her?]  going to Virginia. Upon this occasion we shall send the  [omission in text]
</i> for this year into  Rappahannock   River to supply the  [place of the Carter?]   among   our friends there.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>[Enclosed in the letter above was an extract from a letter, October 28, 1728, Peter Shaw to Athawes.]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have assayed the matter you left me and find it to be copper ore, somewhat stubborn in the fire and not very rich, as affording not an eighth.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  metal   seems to be exceeding soft &amp; ductile the best properties copper can have. for want of an opportunity of working my Testing Furnace  I have not  [omission in text]

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I herewith send you a sample of the produce in Copper and am, Sir,  Your   very &amp;c

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  In 1728, Robert Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

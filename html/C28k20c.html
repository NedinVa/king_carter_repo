<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. The addressee is probably Nicholas Smith because he and William Thornton lived in King George County.</a>

<br><br>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Major William Thornton (d. 1742/43) of King George County. (  <i>King George County Virginia Will Book A-1 1721-1752 And Miscellaneous Notes.</i>  [Fredericksburg, VA: Privately Printed, 1978], p. 277.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Carter probably told his clerk to add to this letter when he copied it the final paragraph of his letter to Thomas Lee of the same date. It read:  "You know that upon these Occasions the Govrs. Clerk who writes these Commissions Expects to be  remembred  I  promist  [h] im all the Service I could do and to be answerable to him for what Gent would be pleased to  depolite  in my hands for him I doubt not  [you] r readiness to forward this matter as far as it  lyes  within your province I am."</a>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Letter book, 1728 August-1731 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>

<br><br>The county and colony have been added for clarity to the heading on this draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] William Camp (Kemp) was described by Carter as "the General Overseer of Mr Burwell's Affairs" and he wrote that Camp earned a salary "&pound;50 . . . for the year 1731." Carter and his son-in-law, Mann Page, were the trustees of Nathaniel Burwell's children after Burwell's death in 1721. Camp was a resident of Gloucester County where most of the Burwell estates lay, and he must also have supervised "Rippon Hall" in nearby York County. (Carter to George Braxton, 1729 November 20, and Carter to William Dawkins,1732  July 11.   <i>Virginia Tax Records.</i>  [Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, Inc., 1983.] p. 539.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] Constantine Cant was the captain of the <i>Burwell.</i> ( Survey Report 6800 for Adm. 68/195, ff. 76v, Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3] This may have been property on Lyon's Creek, Surry County, across the James River from York County where Ripon Hall was located.</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] Captain James Bradby commanded the <i>Micajah and Philip. </i>( Survey report 6801 summarizing Adm. 68/195, ff. 74v, found in the microfilms of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, Albert and Shirley Small  Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n5">[5] Rippon Hall had been Edmund Jening's estate in York County which he had acquired in 1687 from John and Unity West when it was named "Poplar Neck." Jenings's bad financial circumstances forced him to mortgage the property to Carter who eventually acquired title to it. ( "Notes and Queries."  <i>William and Mary Quarterly.</i>  2[Apr. 1894]: 270-278.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n6">[6] Landon Carter (1710-1778) was Carter's seventh child by his second wife, Elizabeth (Landon) Willis. Landon would live at "Sabine Hall," Richmond County, and marry three times, leaving many descendants, some of whom own "Sabine Hall" today. As an adult, he would keep a very interesting and useful diary. A reproduction of a portrait of him may be found on the website of the <a href="http://www.christchurch1735.org/history/robert_carter.html">Foundation of Historic Christ Church.</a> (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B30">Greene.  <i>The Diary of Colonel Landon Carter. . . .</i> </a>)</a>

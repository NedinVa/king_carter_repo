 Rappahannock,  [Lancaster County, Virginia]
</i> <br>
<br>June 24th, 1729<br><br>
To the Rt Honble.<br>
the Lord Fairfax<br>
 
<br>My Lord<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I receiv'd a letter from <a href="Cbiodir.html#MP2">Alderman Perry
</a> of  December  date acqua=<br>
inting me that your Lordship hath been with him to let him know how you should<br>
 wish  your rent which now  entirely  belongs to yourself <a href="Cbiodir.html#WC"> Colonel  Cages
</a> time being expired<br>
In the month after and that he should accordingly pay it and he further tells me<br>
your lordship wanted to know whether I should be willing to  [. . .] ing  lease  after the<br>
old one was Expired In answer I Acquainted him the  lease  would be out in  September  1731<br>
that I was grown old and infirm and that we were fallen into such wretched times<br>
by the Poor Price of  Tobacco  in which your Lordships rents are always Paid when that<br>
Commodity is worth little that I did not know what to say to it However in regard I had<br>
so long  through  so great a Part of my life  served  in your Affairs both in your Ancestors<br>
and in your Own time I adventured to give him instructions to take a new  lease  out from<br>
 your  Lordship and that so soon as your lordship shall  please  to Transact it of this<br>
I suppose you have been Acquainted by this time
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also told him it was some questions with me whether it would<br>
be Proper for me to have a new Power from  your  lordship only and whether it is <br>
necessary I alter the  style  of the grants of your lands for Hitherto I have gran<br>
ted them in the names of your Lordship and  Colonel  Cage as devisee in trust of my<br>
<a href=#n1>lady Fairfax's
</a> Will that it was my thoughts however not withstanding your<br>
Lordship had the  Entire  right to the profits of the Estate yet the trust in  Colonel <br>
Cage is still subscribing and that the Grant should go on In the same  style  but in<br>
this I must submit to better judgements
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also Acquainted Alderman Perry that upon the Crowns<br>
having granted several  Patents  for land According to the best information<br>
I can get within the Plain boundaries of the Grant and Several more  Patents <br>
are daily labouring after I had Entered a Caveat against the Passing any<br>
more  Patents  within these bounds desiring Mr. Alderman to give your Lordship<br>
a full Accot of this matter as I doubt not he hath already or will soon do
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which we have had a hearing before the <a href="Cbiodir.html#WG"> Governor 
</a> &amp;<br>
Council and here with I send  your  Lordship  copies  of all the Papers relating thereto<br>
as also  Copies  of some transactions in former Governours times relating to  your <br>
Lordships Grant
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Papers by a serious Perusal will fully inform<br>
your Lordship of the yeason   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> I go upon in Opposing these<br>
 Patents  this <a href=#n2>little Fork
</a> as it is Called where several  Patents <br>

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>2

</center><br><br>

by the Crown All manner of Persons that Even I have talked with that  [have] <br>
any knowledge of the Places are clear in Affirming that  lies  within  your  L [ord] <br>
ships Express boundary on that side and as to the boundary on the Other si [de] <br>
to the Northwards the great river of  Potomac  as you will be Informed<br>
some of this Papers forks above the Present Inhabitants the Southern b [ranch] <br>
is called  Shenandoah  by the Indians and the main stream of the River <br>
keeps away to the westward and wears the Indians name of Cohonkocut as t [here] <br>
being no Comparison between the largeness of  Shenandoah  and Cononko [cut] <br>
the Maryland Grant is bounded to the Southward by Cohonkocut and there  [are] <br>
many inhabitants seated of Maryland Maryland side a great way beyond  Shenand  [oah] <br>
Even Above branches that issue out of Cohonkocut as above  Shenandoah  No [w if] <br>
Cohonkocut is the Southern boundary to the Maryland grant why it should <br>
be Also the Northern boundary to your Lordships grand is beyond my ca [paci] <br>
ty to find an Argument for And yet our <a href="Cbiodir.html#JG2"> Receiver  General
</a> declares it as hi [s] <br>
Opinion that the lands above  Shenandoah  are clearly the Kings and  [. . .] <br>
to be granted as such and that my laying Claim in your lordships behalf  [. . .] <br>
these lands that are clearly within the Express words of your grant is such<br>
presumption that will Endanger the grant itself Nay I have been willing<br>
that the  Receiver  General should say At this Governours table after the che [ck] <br>
of this Caveat that he  believed  the Proprietors would hardly venture a lawsui [t] <br>
with his majesty and that it was his Opinion the Crown would  compel  t [hem] <br>
to sell the grant and vest it in the Crown Again with such  Elation  do [es] <br>
our  Receiver  General treat your lordships Estates which are granted under<br>
the kings broad Seal and have been allowed and  Confirmed  by such a su [cc] <br>
ession of Crowned heads
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed all our Governours in the time of my Agency h [ath] <br>
treated the Grant and me too with a great deal of Civility and Calm rese [ct] <br>
Particularly our Present Governour whose business it chiefly is to take  [. . . ] <br>
of Asserting the kings boundary to his lands whose Calm and tempera [te] <br>
 carriage  both in this and all other matters hath been very Exemplar [y] 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must Confess if the  Receiver  General can by the strength of<br>
his interest compass bringing your Lordships grant Again into the<br>
hands of the Crown he will gain a Considerable Perquisite to the  [pro] <br>
fits of his Place (As it will be to <a href=#n3>Mr Auditor Blair's
</a> the Commiss [ary's] <br>
kinsman) If he can but keep himself fixed in that also He holds  [the] <br>
Place by the favour of Mr <a href=#n4>Horace  Walpole 
</a>and has his commission<br>
 [. . .]  Upon this bottom I fancy he builds his hopes of  [. . .] <br>
 [. . .] 
</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [. . .] As for these lands in the little Fork and  [. . .] <br>
																		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shenan  [doah] <br>

too will never return much Profit to me in my time but the lands above<br>
 Shenandoah  are very large and Extensive and said to be wonderfully good<br>
and may in time be a vast Addition to your lordships Estate
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus my lord I have laid these matter fully before your <br>
Lordship and have though it my duty under the trust I am not to let<br>
your Lordships Estate be taken Away without any Opposition And I<br>
shall  beg   your  lordship to be very Plain in your directions to me whether<br>
I shall persist in Prosecuting this Affair to settlement of your Lordships<br>
 boundaries  or if your lordship is pleased to be satisfyed in being  confined <br>
to  Shenandoah  to the Westward and to  lose  the little Fork to the Southward<br>
as well as the great fork which the Crown hath already taken Possession of<br>
 althogh  I never yet could see any reason for it Be  pleased  to let me have your instru<br>
ctions upon this whole matter to be my guide for the future
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late controversy I had with <a href="Cbiodir.html#HD"> Colonel  Drysdale
</a> our then  governor <br>
it  Appeared  that both your lordship and  Colonel  Cage  relied  Chiefly Upon Alder-<br>
man Perry to Personate that Affair for you before their Lordships the <a href=#n5>bo=<br>
ard of Trade
</a> therefore I have thought it Proper to send him  copies  of All the<br>
Papers that I now send to your lordship that he may be fully Apprized of this<br>
Controversy relating to the boundarys and may be Prepared to make Appli-<br>
cation where he shall think it necessary for your lordships Service and interest<br>
 believing  your Lordship will still think it necessary to  desire  his Assistance
</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing more I shall take the liberty to mention to your <br>
Lordship In these late years since the Backwoods have come to be seated thick <br>
with inhabitants abundance of Peoples are making daily searches after mines <br>
in the mountainous barren Lands  it is  the Current Opinions that there are very <br>
rich Ores in some of these mountains if any could be so lucky to find them out <br>
There are now within your lordships grant Two Iron furnaces Erected that <br>
are brought to Pretty good Perfections and there is Plenty of Iron Ore I believe <br>
as good as in the world the two Furnaces belong the one to Bristol the other to <br>
London There are two Places in the back woods also that have some  [veins?]  <br>
of Copper ore that are at a great distance from water  Carriage  and will be <br>
Attended with very great charges to do any thing with them There is a Compa <br>
of Bristol  Merchants  that have sent in men  skilled  in those Affairs to search <br>
into the bowels of the Earth after this Copper Ore but some of them make hea<br>
vy Complaints to me that the terms of your Lordships Grants your lands  [. . .]  <br>
are too hard and discouraging having An Exception of All royal mines <br>
and a full third of All lead Copper Tin Coals Iron &amp;c: I tell these go [. . .]  <br>
men I follow the steps of my Predecessors they made the limit a [. . . ]  be [fore]  <br>
my time I dare not make any Alteration without Particular  [. . .] <br>

<hr width="75%"><center>-<i>4

</center><br><br>
but to sooth them a little I told  [them]  I would try the matter before your Lord [ship] <br>
Upon the great  discouragement  they say there is by the large  [. . . ] tions <br>
grant And the Hazards they shall inn [omission in text]
</i> as well as the great charge they <br>
be at And at last it may be miss of finding any veins of Ore that may be worth <br>
while they threaten to discontinue their Searches 
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never yet Could find any directions from the Proprietors  [. . .]  <br>
the  terms  respecting the Ores the Grants should be made upon Upon   [<i>sic
</i>]
</i> the p [rior?]  <br>
Exerting of the Northern Neck Grant people were very Careless what was writ [ten]  <br>
they were Underrespecting mines having in their terms very little or no Exp [ecta]  <br>
tion of finding What these Adventurers will do a deal of time and a g [reat] <br>
deal of Charge must be spent before the Event will be seen
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find in <a href="Cbiodir.html#PL"> Colonel  Ludwells
</a> book of grants the Exceptions to m  [ines]  <br>
were much more favourable to the takers up of Land  than  they were made  [by?] <br>
<a href=#n6> Colonel   Fitzhughs 
</a> &amp; <a href=#n7> Captain  Brent
</a> who succeeded to  Colonel  Ludwell in the Agency th [e] <br>
limitations I have followed Even since and never till of late took notice  [of] <br>
the difference betwen Ludwells grants And Fitzhugh's
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein I send  your  lordship the  terms  of  Colonel  Ludwells Gran [t] <br>
how this difference came to be made between these Grants Agents I can ['t] <br>
tell I can hardly think Fitzhugh had any new instructions from the P [ropietors] <br>
now whether your lordship will think fit to Encourage the taking up of y [our] <br>
Barren mountainous lands which have little or no temptation in the Surf [ace] <br>
of them to give me orders to make a relaxation in respect to the benefit of fron [tier?] <br>
mines and ores I shall submit to  your  determination I cannot but think  Colonel <br>
Ludwell who was the first that Entered on the Proprietors business set out w [ith] <br>
full and plain instruction from the Proprietors and strictly Borrowed them i [n] <br>
the forming his grants however this Alteration came to be made afterward
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many various Subjects to be spoken Clearly to hath necessaril [y] <br>
drawn this letter into An Uncommon length for which I hope  your  Lordships<br>
Pardon
</p>


<br>My Lord<br>
your Lordships<br>
Most Obedient<br>
Most Obliged &amp;<br>
Most Humble Servt<br>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] Catherine Culpeper, widow of the fifth Lord Fairfax (d. 1710); from her father, the 2nd Lord Culpeper, she had inherited about 1689 his five-sixths interest in the Northern Neck Proprietary in Virginia. Lord Fairfax consulted Micajah Perry about the affairs of the Propietary, and Perry had recommended Robert Carter to be the Virginia agent in 1702. He held the post until 1710 when Lady Fairfax transferred the agency to Edmund Jenings with Thomas Lee as the deputy agent. When she died in 1719, she bequeathed her Virginia property to her son Tom, but she made Wiliam Cage and Edward Filmer, trustees of the proprietary. Filmer soon died, and Cage, a kinsman of the 6th Lord Fairfax, became the sole trustee. From his grandmother, Margaret Lady Culpeper, the 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the other one-sixth of the Proprietary. Cage consulted Perry, and Robert Carter was again made agent in 1721, holding the post until his death ten years later.

</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant Robert Cary, July 24, 1727, to cover a bill of lading (not present) for 12 hogsheads of tobacco and to inform him that he is sending the public papers for forwarding by him as he has received most recent public papers through him. In a post script on August 22, 1727, Carter deals with the problem of Thomas Evans' bankruptcy by informing Cary that he is sending his account with Evans (not present) and a "Short warrant" to empower Cary to act as his attorney in attempting to collect the money Evans owed Carter.

</b> Original letter is from Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. Carter has added in his hand the close to the post script as is indicated by the use of bold italics. The post script is from Robert Carter letter book, 1727 May-1728 July, Robert Carter Papers (acc. no. 3807), Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia.
</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.

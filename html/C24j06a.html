</a><br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to persons abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity.
</a><br><br> This is the ecipient's copy; the conjoined address leaf bears the following:  To | Wm: Cage Esqr  | Of Milgate In the Parish of Bearshead | In the county of | Kent | Via Glasgow. There is no endorsement. The letter was signed by Carter in a very large and bold hand (indicated here by the use of bold italics) and sealed with his arms.

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. The first page or pages of this letter are missing; this letter concludes on the letter book page on which the succeeding letter (to Mann Page, August 27, 1729) was begun, and has accordingly been assigned that date. The leaves on which the draft was written have suffered some damage with portions missing along the margins affecting the text as well as smaller damage elsewhere.</a>

<br><br>The name of Carter's home, "Corotoman," the county, and colony have been added for clarity to this unheaded draft.</a>

<br><br>The last paragraph of the addition to this letter is in the hand of a different clerk.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] John Warner was the surveyor of King George County in 1727; he laid off the town of Falmouth in 1728. Later he worked for Lord Fairfax, and prepared an important map of his holdings. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison,   <i>Landmarks of Old Prince William</i> , 626-628.</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] "In 1724, Robert Carter took out patents for, among others: the Licking Run tract of 10,227 acres which lay along and east of Licking Run above Germantown and across Owl and Turkey Runs, to what was then supposed to be the western boundary of the vast Brent Town Tract. Here Carter seated the Lodge Quarter mentioned in his will."  Timothy Dargan was its overseer in 1732. ( Carl F. Cannon, Jr., "Robert ("King") Carter of "Corotoman." Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Duke University, 1956, p. 274;</a> and <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#A26">Carter Papers: An Inventory. . . ."</a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n3">[3]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Horsepen Run joins Broad Run on the northern border of Dulles airport. The company was not successful. (<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B32">Morton.  <i>Robert Robert Carter of Nomini Hall.</i>  pp. 18-19;</a> and <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/users/berkeley/public/Cbibl.html#B4">Harrison.  <i>Landmarks. . . .</i>  p. 342. </a>)</a>

<br><br><a name="n4">[4] It is not clear to what property Carter refers because there is no tract with this name in his will.</a>

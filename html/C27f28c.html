Because a large share of the estate's tobacco is being sent to Dawkins this year, he hopes the merchant will exert himself to get the best prices for it to justify Carter's faith in him. He sends an invoice (not present) for goods for the Burwell children, and two bills of exchange. Adam Graves has come to see Carter to deny that he has made disparaging remarks about the <i>Carter,</i> and Carter asks Dawkins to forget what he has written previously about Graves in this matter. He reports that Captain Dove (of the <i>Carter</i>) hopes to have a load of 300 hogsheads, but will probably not make the next fleet. In closing, he notes that he has been preparing invoices for his goods in hopes of receiving them earlier than usual, but they are not ready. In a lengthy post script dated July 26th, Carter adds details of many bills of exchange, sends an order (not present) for goods, payment to him of a debt due Dawkins from George Devenport, the further problems of Captain Dove and the <i>Carter,</i> and the news in the colony of the raising of the siege of Gibralter. In a second post script dated August 22nd, he reports that the <i>Carter</i> will sail without being fully loaded which he attributes to her late arrival in the colony. He sends an invoice and a bill of lading (not present) and a number of bills of exchange.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">William Dawkins,</a> June 28, July 26, and August 22, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappahannock, [Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>June the 28th: 1727<br><br>Mr: Wm: Dawkins<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yor: Ship <a href="Cbiodir.html#"> Baily </a> makes ones of this first Fleet <br>there are on board her 28 hhds: belonging to <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Mr. Burwells</a> Estate and <br>of his best Crops  Consignd  to you a bill of Lading I Expect <a href="Cbiodir.html#">Colonel Page</a> <br>Sends you a large Share of those Tobbos: comes under your management <br>this year I hope you will Exert your Self in keeping up <sup><font color="green">their</i></font></sup> reputation <br>and not let mine Suffer in ordering So much to you.

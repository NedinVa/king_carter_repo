 <i>Letter from Robert Carter to the Earl of Orkney, August 8 and 28, 1728</i> 
</a>
</h3></font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to the governor of the Colony, the Earl of Orkney, August 8, 1728, to send a bill of exchange for the governor's final portion of the fees collected during Carter's administration as acting lieutenant governor. He also requests an additional letter of recommendation for his son. In a post script dated August 28th, Carter responds to  a letter just received from Orkney from which he has learned that William Dawkins apparently has refused to honor a bill of exchange sent by Carter's son.</p>

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> Robert Carter Letter Book, 1727 April 13-1728 July 23, Carter Family Papers, Virginia Historical Society, Richmond. There is a 19th-century transcript of the letter in the Minor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia. The leaf bearing this letter has suffered some marginal damage.</a>

<br><br>A different clerk as entered the words "to be Copyd" at the head of the letter as is indicated by the use of italics.</a>

<br><br>Robert Carter generally used a return address of "Rappahannock" for the river on which he lived rather than "Corotoman," the name of his home, on his correspondence, especially to merchants abroad. The county and colony have been added for clarity to the  heading on the draft.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1] A moiety is one of two approximately equal portions.</a>

<br><br><a name="n2">[2] No information about Captain Wilcox has been located.</a>

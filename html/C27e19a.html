He reminds Stark that he wants these accounts regularly, and notes that he has paid John Pemberton the 2 1/2 per cent Pemberton was charged for a bill of exchange he had written on Stark. He has suffered great losses among his slaves, and will have to write bills on Stark to pay for the new ones. He complains that Stark has not reported to him that the <i>Ann &amp; Eliza,</i> on which he had shipped tobacco to Stark, had been driven ashore in a storm, but the cargo saved. Thirty hogsheads of tobacco will be sent Stark by Captain Bowman.</p>                 <hr><br><center><h3>Letter from Robert Carter to <a href=#n1>John Stark,</a> May 19, 1727</h3></font></center><hr width="75%"><center>-<i>1</i>-</center><br> Rappa[hannock, Lancaster County, Virginia]</i></font></sup> <br><br>May 19th: 1727<br><br>Mr. John Stark<br> <br>Sir -- <br><br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=#n2>Capt: Bowman</a> after a tedious passage found <br>the way in at last.

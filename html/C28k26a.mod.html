<br>
 
<br>Dear Sir<br>

<br>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I wrote to you about your <a href=#n1>Copper ore</a> I have had another  trial   made of it &amp; I find the  Amount   Dr. Shaw gave me of it is confirm'd by this Experiment. It will produce 1/8 pure Copper. I have  endeavoured   to inform mySelf of the Value of it &amp; though I cannot be so thoroughly  certain of it as I should if I had a larger Quantity sent, I believe it will  Yield   from 6 to 8 &pound; per Ton if not more, the Duty is but a trifle at 2/6 per Ton. The freight I suppose may be 20 shillings per Ton in ore the Charges here for Cartage Porters &amp;c besides the Commission I would suppose at the utmost  would   not amount to ten shillings per Ton so that  though   you should agree to allow 5 per hundred weight Commission there will be &pound;6 per Ton to pay for the Charge of Casks &amp; Labour in  Virginia   out of which must remain so large a profit that will Strongly induce you to  dig   &amp; manage the Mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartily glad to see so good a prospect for you of making your fortune without the trouble of Labouring for it, here nature &amp; providence has done that for you which  the best Tobacco plantation at this time of day is not able to effect</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Shaw spent an  evening  with me last week. He has  tried   your ore for the Silver but he finds that  Would   not answer. he could make no Silver from the piece of ore he had</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very rich mine of Copper ore in New York from whence you may learn the way to mange yours, &amp; get information that may be of use to you in many respects, the produce of that mine is generally sent to Bristol &amp; is sold for 40 or 45 &pound; per Ton. That market may probably do as well or better for you than this, &amp; therefore I advise you to send some of your ore thither &amp; some here which  will be the way to know exactly.</p>

<br>Sir  Your   Affectionate friend &amp; Servant

<center><h3>NOTES</h3></font></center>

<br><br><i><b>Source copy consulted:</b></i></b> The nineteenth-century transcript of this letter in theMinor-Blackford Papers, James Monroe Law Office and Museum, Fredericksburg, Virginia, did not indicate line or page breaks, and omits some material.</a>

<br><br><a name="n1">[1]  In 1728, Carter, his sons Robert and Charles, and his son-in-law Mann Page,  organized a company to mine for copper on a tract of some 27,000 acres that Louis Morton describes as lying "near the present boundary of Fairfax and Loudoun counties." Fairfax Harrison wrote that the tract was "on the  Horsepen of Broad." Today, there is a Frying Pan Park just east of the border of the Dulles Airport reservation, and there are other things with the name in the area. The company was not successful.

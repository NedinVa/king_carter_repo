</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to his friend, Major George Eskridge, of Westmoreland County September 21, 1727, concerning the sale of slaves that will prevent him from attending a survey, and calling on Eskridge to help him find buyers for the slaves. He informs Eskridge that the packet from the governor of Maryland that Eskridge has forwarded concerns a robbery committed in Virginia by Maryland citizens, and that he has forwarded it to the new governor of Virginia.

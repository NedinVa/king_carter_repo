</center><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Carter writes to London merchant William Dawkins, March 6, 1724, reporting on the activities of Captain Adam Graves in the colony. Graves has over 200 hogsheads of tobacco on board and his men are out with his sloops seeking more, but he has decided to sail on schedule whether or not the ship is full. Carter understands from a letter from Thomas Evans that the <i>Carter
</i> and Captain Richardson's ship are bound for the colony but Carter is doubtful about their being able to get a full cargo; he will have only 40 hogsheads.
